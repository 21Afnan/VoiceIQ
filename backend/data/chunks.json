Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8."

My child was born in October and is now in FS1 – I want to enrol him in another school for FS2. Can I do this or does he have to repeat a year? Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8."
