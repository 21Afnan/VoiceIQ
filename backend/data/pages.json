This is the essence of Positive Education (PosEd). A scientifically-proven concept, PosEd is causing a paradigm shift in global education where parents, schools and governments realise the need to increase a child’s ‘wellbeing’ to raise his/her levels of ‘achievement’. PosEd brings together the science of Positive Psychology combined with the best teaching practices to enable individuals, schools, and communities to flourish, be resilient, creative, successful and happy. Sunmarke – A Character-Building School Multiple studies on the effects of PosEd testify that improved levels of a child’s wellbeing are associated with higher levels of academic engagement, social skills, optimism, behaviour, and fewer mental health-related issues. Positive Education – Sunmarke’s DNA Positive Education (PosEd) is not an additional subject at Sunmarke but it’s woven into the fabric of the international school’s culture and is reflected in all its activities and teaching mechanisms. Sunmarke’s teachers undergo an intense training programme before entering the classroom where they learn, live, teach and embed Positive Education. This is what our teachers say about the Positive Education training they receive at Sunmarke: “Where amazing happens. A motto that at first glance just appears to be some words to attract parents to send their children to Sunmarke school, almost like a gimmick. Over the past 3 days for me amazing did happen. The positive education training took me on a journey of self-discovery, showing me that changing my mindset can bring positive outcomes. I realized I have the power to make a difference in people’s lives. This training was the best I’ve ever received from a school, as they genuinely cared about us, ensuring we could apply what we learned in teaching and at home. It was an incredible experience, especially since I used to dislike training due to its lack of usefulness. This was entirely different – truly helpful, purposeful, and enlightening. It taught me to believe in the potential of education to inspire change.” “The breadth of knowledge, evidence-based theories, outstanding coordination and delivery, and just everything about this week was outstanding! I was blown away in every way possible and feel so supported, valued, and appreciated.” The ‘Flourish’ Model The 6 Key Skills Practised and Taught by Sunmarke Teachers for Students to Incorporate in Their Lives SUNMARKE'S WELLBEING & COUNSELLING TEAM Our PosEd and wellbeing approach fosters deep trust in our school community, creating a safe, welcoming and nurturing environment. We embed various initiatives into the daily routines, curriculum and extracurricular activities to establish a personal, social and academic support system each child needs to flourish. Class and Form Tutors, Heads of Year, and Subject teachers support students every day through direct teaching, mentoring, workshops and assemblies. The Counselling Department provides compassionate care for children who may require professional support and or simply a sympathetic listening ear. Students and parents both have access to a School Counsellor. A ‘Wellbeing Champion’ represents the school leadership in our Parent Association and ‘Friends of Sunmarke School’ (FOSS) group while the popular monthly ‘Wellness Wednesday’ event raises awareness among parents about crucial topics like strength-based parenting, raising children in the digital age and health and nutrition. SUNMARKE'S SAFEGUARDING & CHILD PROTECTION TEAM Sunmarke has a designated Safeguarding and Child Protection Team with Child Protection Officers at every Key Stage in primary and secondary school.

Children acquire new skills through 7 areas of learning and development. In the initial stages, three Prime Areas are in focus: Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language Development. Growing up, the Prime Areas help develop skills in 4 Specific Areas: Literacy Mathematics Understanding of the World Expressive Arts and Design Laying the Foundations for Lifelong Learning in FS1 and FS2 At Sunmarke, our Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), comprising FS1 (Nursery) and FS2 (Reception) , offers a broad, balanced, and enriching curriculum for children aged 3 to 5. Rooted in the British curriculum and recognised as one of Dubai’s leading EYFS providers, our programme nurtures each child’s unique strengths and interests through play-based, inquiry-led learning. A Curriculum Designed Around the Whole Child The EYFS curriculum at FS1 and FS2 is structured around seven key areas of learning and development: Prime Areas (Early Focus): Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language These areas are particularly emphasised in FS1 , helping our youngest learners develop the essential foundations of confidence, relationships, movement, and communication. Specific Areas (Building on the Foundations): Literacy Mathematics Understanding the World Expressive Arts and Design As children progress into FS2 , these specific areas become more prominent, supporting emerging literacy and numeracy skills, creative expression, and a growing awareness of the world. Characteristics of Effective Learning Across FS1 and FS2, we recognise that children learn in different ways. The EYFS framework promotes three key learning characteristics: Playing and Exploring: Investigating and experiencing, ‘having a go’ Active Learning: Concentrating, persevering, and celebrating achievement Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing ideas, making connections, and problem-solving These traits guide how learning is planned and delivered across both FS1 and FS2, ensuring that each child’s development is supported in a way that reflects their interests, needs, and learning styles. Learning Through Play and Projects At Sunmarke, we view play as a powerful vehicle for learning in both FS1 and FS2. Our curriculum is intentionally designed to offer rich, purposeful play experiences that allow children to explore, imagine, and make sense of the world in a way that is meaningful to them. In FS1 , children are encouraged to investigate through hands-on exploration, sensory play, and open-ended experiences that develop early communication, social, and physical skills. As they transition into FS2 , children engage in more structured yet still playful learning that builds early literacy and numeracy skills while continuing to promote creativity and curiosity. Our project-based learning approach further enhances engagement. Each term, both FS1 and FS2 children explore exciting, inquiry-led themes such as “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Somewhere Out There,” and “Up, Up and Away.” These projects spark imagination and are shaped by the children’s own interests and questions, creating a deep sense of ownership and wonder. Whether FS1 children are building a fairy tale castle or FS2 pupils are investigating the planets, our environments are carefully curated to provide challenge, joy, and discovery. Through child-initiated and adult-guided activities, children develop critical thinking, collaboration, and communication—the building blocks of future learning. A Holistic and Nurturing Approach At Sunmarke, we believe that every child in FS1 and FS2 is a unique individual. Our holistic approach to early education goes beyond academics to nurture each child’s emotional, social, physical, and intellectual development. We incorporate globally respected early years methodologies including elements of the Reggio Emilia philosophy , Montessori principles , and the Curiosity Approach . This eclectic framework values child-led exploration, independence, and a strong connection to the learning environment—creating rich opportunities for discovery and expression. Our learning spaces are thoughtfully designed to be calm, beautiful, and engaging, reflecting the importance of the environment as the ‘third teacher’. Teachers and support staff observe closely, respond sensitively, and plan responsively to extend learning in authentic, meaningful ways. Strong partnerships with parents, a passionate team of educators, and a shared belief in the limitless potential of every child create a warm, supportive community. In FS1 and FS2, children feel safe, seen, and inspired—laying a confident foundation for their journey through school and life. Characteristics of Effective Learning The characteristics of Effective Learning describe how children learn and respond to teaching in the Foundation Stage, a factor determined by their individual learning characteristic. Three traits of effective teaching and learning identified by the EYFS are: Playing and Exploring: Finding out, discovering, willing to ‘have a go’ and playing with what they know Active Learning: Being involved and concentrating, trying and persevering, taking pleasure from achievements Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing their own ideas, making links and selecting their own ways to complete tasks 7 Curriculum Areas To enhance the learning experience and make it impactful, Sunmarke has selected 7 curriculum areas taught through unique projects and interests, most of which are child-initiated activities that incorporate elements of imagination, investigation and ‘out of the box’ ideas, concepts and solutions. The EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play which enhances critical thinking abilities, fuels risk-taking and creative skills. Examples of topics are ‘I believe I can fly’, ‘Somewhere out there’ and ‘Up up and away.’ The initiative EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play. Our teaching philosophy is designed to treat all children as unique individuals in their own right. Our holistic approach towards education ensures that parents/carers, class teachers, specialist teachers and learning assistants work very effectively together to support our firm belief that ‘every child is unique’. Our maxim is that happy and well-motivated children are good learners. The Foundation Stage is a safe, secure and friendly environment for our youngest children to gain confidence and independence, as they prepare for the next stage of schooling. It is a foundation for future learning. Characteristics of Effective Learning (CoEL) are a revived element in the current Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum (EYFS). CoEL advocates that while planning and guiding children’s activities, practitioners must reflect on the different ways that students learn, and these lessons must be reflected in their practice."

Blending a range of outstanding Early Years practices from the best international schools, we commit to a child-initiated learning approach and a sophisticated play-based curriculum that enables students to fulfil their unique potential. Sunmarke’s Amazing Philosophy and Journey A- Autonomy: Children are central to everything we do; all projects stem directly from their interests. M – Mindset: In line with Sunmarke’s ‘Positive Education’ ethos, we teach children to have a ‘Growth Mindset’, encouraging endless possibilities. A- Academics: We provide a broad, balanced yet innovative British curriculum based on the Early Years Foundation Stage, building the bedrock for the future. Z -Zest: Happiness is a key agenda at Sunmarke School; we truly believe that if a child is happy and enthusiastic, they learn better. I – Individuality: Our personalised curriculum ensures every child’s individuality is recognised. Strong teacher/pupil relationships allows tutors to identify and cater to a child’s interests, strengths and challenges. N – Nurture: We nurture every child to enable them to grow and reach their fullest potential. G – Grow: Every child that enters EYFS has a special and incredible journey that helps them grow and develop into happy, healthy teens. Learning Through Play Imaginative and creative play is how children learn about the world. During imaginative play, they manipulate materials, express themselves verbally and non-verbally, plan, act, interact, react and try different roles. Learning is most effective when children participate in creative play with dolls, vehicles, blocks, rocks, cardboard, or boxes. Employing creative thinking while manipulating play dough, creating recipes by mixing dirt and water, working with art materials, splashing in puddles, or pretending to fly can further child development. Imagination fosters cognitive and social development by allowing children to contemplate different resolutions, thus boosting their self-confidence. Our Early Years Foundation Stage has been rated as ‘ Outstanding ’ in the latest KHDA’s DSIB inspection report (2023-24) with ‘ Outstanding Personal Development & Learning Skills and Outstanding Curriculum and Curriculum Adaptation’."

Children acquire new skills through 7 areas of learning and development. In the initial stages, three Prime Areas are in focus: Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language Development. Growing up, the Prime Areas help develop skills in 4 Specific Areas: Literacy Mathematics Understanding of the World Expressive Arts and Design Laying the Foundations for Lifelong Learning in FS1 and FS2 At Sunmarke, our Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), comprising FS1 (Nursery) and FS2 (Reception) , offers a broad, balanced, and enriching curriculum for children aged 3 to 5. Rooted in the British curriculum and recognised as one of Dubai’s leading EYFS providers, our programme nurtures each child’s unique strengths and interests through play-based, inquiry-led learning. A Curriculum Designed Around the Whole Child The EYFS curriculum at FS1 and FS2 is structured around seven key areas of learning and development: Prime Areas (Early Focus): Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language These areas are particularly emphasised in FS1 , helping our youngest learners develop the essential foundations of confidence, relationships, movement, and communication. Specific Areas (Building on the Foundations): Literacy Mathematics Understanding the World Expressive Arts and Design As children progress into FS2 , these specific areas become more prominent, supporting emerging literacy and numeracy skills, creative expression, and a growing awareness of the world. Characteristics of Effective Learning Across FS1 and FS2, we recognise that children learn in different ways. The EYFS framework promotes three key learning characteristics: Playing and Exploring: Investigating and experiencing, ‘having a go’ Active Learning: Concentrating, persevering, and celebrating achievement Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing ideas, making connections, and problem-solving These traits guide how learning is planned and delivered across both FS1 and FS2, ensuring that each child’s development is supported in a way that reflects their interests, needs, and learning styles. Learning Through Play and Projects At Sunmarke, we view play as a powerful vehicle for learning in both FS1 and FS2. Our curriculum is intentionally designed to offer rich, purposeful play experiences that allow children to explore, imagine, and make sense of the world in a way that is meaningful to them. In FS1 , children are encouraged to investigate through hands-on exploration, sensory play, and open-ended experiences that develop early communication, social, and physical skills. As they transition into FS2 , children engage in more structured yet still playful learning that builds early literacy and numeracy skills while continuing to promote creativity and curiosity. Our project-based learning approach further enhances engagement. Each term, both FS1 and FS2 children explore exciting, inquiry-led themes such as “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Somewhere Out There,” and “Up, Up and Away.” These projects spark imagination and are shaped by the children’s own interests and questions, creating a deep sense of ownership and wonder. Whether FS1 children are building a fairy tale castle or FS2 pupils are investigating the planets, our environments are carefully curated to provide challenge, joy, and discovery. Through child-initiated and adult-guided activities, children develop critical thinking, collaboration, and communication—the building blocks of future learning.

We do this by empowering our students through an innovative and character-building education that inspires them to thrive and achieve with purpose. Our curriculum design serves to reflect this. Whilst maintaining academic rigour through the British National Curriculum, our holistic Positive Education ethos and ambitious commitment to innovative technology ensures our children achieve outstanding academic, social and personal success. Additionally, opportunities for Forest School lessons and outdoor learning are provided to all Primary students. Therefore, the drivers for our curriculum are based on two principles: all learning is purposeful with real-life application and context; and students can make connections across interdisciplinary skills. STEAM With the opening of our dedicated STEAM Centre, SPACE-X, and the addition of specialist resident design technology and computing teachers, we have redesigned our curriculum to take us from our thematic roots to design thinking, using the Stanford d.school approach below. Whilst English and maths remain explicitly on the timetable, children work on STEAM theme projects across science, design technology, engineering, the arts, maths and humanities, with the option to also make purposeful links to our UAE moral, social and cultural studies and Values in Action objectives . Living in the UAE, it is vital we also make purposeful links to our local surroundings, Islamic culture and Arabic language. This hands-on approach to problem-solving enables each STEAM theme to culminate in a proposed project which requires the students to design/make/create something which draws upon the knowledge and skills which they have learnt over the course of the project . During each STEAM project , each class will spend two weeks in SPACE-X, where the support of our specialists will enable children’s designs to come to life. Primary Core Subjects Primary Foundation Subjects English History Mathematics Geography STEAM (including science) Modern Foreign languages (MFL): French/Mandarin Arabic Art & Design Islamic Computing Values in Action/moral, social and cultural studies Music Physical Education (including swimming) In addition to the subjects above, Sunmarke offers a diverse range of sports, co-curricular and enrichment activities to supplement the academic programme."

Students are taught to appreciate art and design from different periods, created by famous composers, engineers, linguists and sporting heroes. This enhances their knowledge of form, texture, pitch, tone, coding and robotics, pronunciation and composition, and timing and precision. These skills are further built upon in ECAs, including our Performing Arts elective that prepares students for the annual musical performance. Stimulating displays in classrooms and corridors result in widespread appreciation of their achievements and efforts throughout the year. Music There is something for everyone in Sunmarke’s music department. Our specialist music teachers ignite every child’s passion for music, be they a grade 7 pianist or an enthusiast in different musical genres. Students are encouraged to perform as much as possible: in assemblies, concerts, school productions – our school is their stage! See the highlight pictures below from our previous musical, which brought High School Musical to life with our talented Primary students. Stay tuned for this year’s spectacular production of Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical ! Performances There are many opportunities for students to shine on stage at Sunmarke Primary, with a vibrant calendar of performances that celebrate creativity, confidence and collaboration.

Environment and Sustainability Sustainability is a key agenda at Sunmarke School.

As an inclusive school, Sunmarke offers a wide range of options at Key Stage 4. Through offering GCSE, IGCSE, and BTEC courses, we are able to accommodate a wide range of learning styles, whilst ensuring the level of challenge is such that all post-16 pathways remain open to students. GCSE examinations are the mainstay of an English education, with most students following this pathway. At Sunmarke we also offer IGCSE examinations; the ‘I’ stands for international and means the course has been adapted to suit a more international student body. The difficulty level of GCSE and IGCSE exams are the same, but the content of GCSE examinations is more English-centred. A good example of this would be in Business Studies where the case studies for a GCSE would be UK companies, which many of our students would not have heard of. This is why we follow the IGCSE pathway for Business Studies, meaning the case studies focus on large multi-national companies all our students would know. BTEC courses are as challenging as GCSE course but are assessed in a different manner. All BTEC courses are coursework based, with students undertaking assessed units every 12 weeks or so, these are all graded, and the outcome is the sum of these assessments. BTEC courses suit students who prefer to ‘chunk’ their assessments rather than taking one or two summative exams at the end of the course which determine their final outcome. Compulsory subjects and options choices All students study the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, Arabic, Games and Moral, Social Cultural Studies. In addition to these core subjects, students also select four additional subjects from our extensive list of optional subjects. Each of these subjects is listed below with a brief outline of the course content and the method of assessment. Students who have been identified as requiring individual support will have their number of subjects reduced to allow for intervention. Arabic A What is involved? In Arabic, students will learn to speak, listen, read, write and communicate effectively in Arabic, as well as develop awareness and understanding of countries and communities where Arabic is spoken. How will I be assessed? This Edexcel International GCSE in Arabic (First Language) qualification comprises two external written assessed papers. Paper 1, written examination, 70% of the total International GCSE marks, 2 hours 15 minutes, which includes 10 minutes’ recommended reading time. 70 marks Paper 2, written examination, produce two pieces of continuous writing. Students will Choose two titles from a choice of six 1 hour 30 minutes. 60 marks Grammatical usage which will be tested in Paper 1, Section 3 This course will also be supplemented with Ministry of Education assessments for Arab students. Arabic B What does it involve? Paper 1: Listening and Understanding in Arabic Students are assessed on their understanding of standard spoken Arabic in a variety of scenarios.

The Duke Of Edinburgh Award The Duke of Edinburgh International Award, founded in 1956 by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh is the world’s leading youth achievement award, bringing together experiences and life skills to equip young people for life. The concept of the Award is of individual challenge designed to encourage young people between 14 and 25 to develop into responsible, active citizens who will contribute towards society. What’s involved? The Award is voluntary, non-competitive, enjoyable and balanced, and requires students to expend effort over a period of time. There are three levels to the Award: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Young people design their own Award programme, set their own goals and record their own progress. They can choose four categories: Service, Physical Recreation or a Skills activity, or go on an Expedition. Here are some more details of each segment. Service The Award gives students the opportunity to give back to the community and make a real difference to the people or wildlife/animals, or to contribute to a good cause. It acquaints students with the joy of giving. Examples include: first aid, visiting and supporting people in need, volunteering at hospitals, sports coaching, charity work, etc. Physical Recreation Physical Recreation, both individually and within a team, is a fun and healthy way of developing a real sense of achievement outside the classroom, instilling enthusiasm and feeling of wellbeing. Examples include: Ball Sports, Athletics, Water Sports, Winter Sports, Martial Arts, Animal Sports, etc. Skill The Award encourages students to learn something new as a part of the process. Whether their interests lie in skiing or photography, the Award allows them to explore their passions. Examples include: Music, Arts and Crafts, Nature and the Environment, Communication, Games and Sports and related skills, etc. The Adventurous Journey The Adventurous Journey section is about undertaking a team journey or expedition. Participants plan, train for and undertake a journey with a purpose in an unfamiliar environment. Students spend 2 days and 1 night away completing around 12 hours of purposeful effort in total.

Through our different pathways, we encourage students to ask questions about the world around them and think from multiple perspectives. We are unique in offering A-Levels, BTECs, and being an IB World School, we also offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Whether students choose the A-Level, BTEC; or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme pathway, we inspire purpose and drive passion. Here at Sunmarke we care about the journey that students go on and the skills they develop along the way. Our students are not defined by grades, they are a collection of skills and interests that show their passion, and we want them to strive to be better learners to best prepare them for the path they choose after they graduate. Students will develop these skills through sessions run in form time on developing as a learner and preparing for higher education. While attending sessions for the latter, students will be exposed to resources that will help them explore their passions through reading, videos and courses outside of the curriculum that are now available online at the click of a button. Outside of the form room is where you will differ in terms of skills developed. The International Baccalaureate Programmes places more of an emphasis in developing a variety of skills due to the diverse subjects students have to take whereas A-Levels allow students to delve deeper into a smaller selection of subjects.

Leadership All students at Sunmarke’s Sixth Form are leaders and role models and they embrace this responsibility fully. These young leaders play a crucial role in the growth of the school and the community. Within their academics, students are provided options to lead their own learning such as through the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), available to A Level and BTEC students or through various pieces of coursework, such as the Extended Essay and Reflective Project on the International Baccalaureate pathways. There are several opportunities for students to assume leadership roles, form their own extra-curricular activities and represent the school as Senior Prefects, Senior Student Leadership Team, House Captains and Subject Ambassadors. Thinking Skills Preparing students to flourish in an environment that encourages critical and independent thinking, Sunmarke’s Sixth Form is imbued with the Positive Education approach. Students are trained through the Theory of Knowledge (TOK) curriculum that motivates them to ask questions about the world around them and think from multiple perspectives. Digital Learning Sixth Form students model the use and integration of digital technologies throughout their curriculum. Many digital tools are available such as Questia School, an online library and UniFrog, a platform for search, shortlist and applying for university courses. Sixth Form Students are taught to be at ease with technology, but also encouraged to question its validity, reliability and responsibility in a modern world. Media literacy is given a lot of importance at Sunmarke as students prepare to navigate the world beyond the school. Please view our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy here . Social Responsibility Sunmarke Sixth Formers take the lead in service, learning and providing solutions while developing collaboration, leadership and social skills. There are structured programmes for students to follow such as CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) and Service Learning that lists a set of objectives to be used as guidance. These are ‘need and solution-based’ programmes where students can choose to give service to their peers, the school, the local community and even make a global difference. These programmes make them understand the difference they can make to the world while developing emotional intelligence. Global Outlook As an international school training students to excel globally, we foster an ethos of honesty, responsibility, tolerance and respect for others within the academic and Positive Education curriculum. Sixth Form students take a leading role in celebrations such as International Day by sharing their own cultures and traditions with the rest of the community. As a multi-pathway school, we aim to make our students global citizens.

Advanced Level qualifications (known as A-Levels) are individual subject based qualifications. They are one option available to students who are looking to study at university. With A-Levels being standalone qualifications, there is no requirement on subject combinations and students’ only constraint is the combinations available within the school timetable. A-Levels are graded from A*-E. What does this Pathway look like? Students will usually take 3 or 4 A-Levels and this would be what universities would be looking for as offers are based mainly on 3 A-Level grades. If you are debating which subjects to choose, we recommend you start with 4 A-Levels so you can have a range to begin with which you can narrow down later. Students will receive 6 lessons per subject each week with most subjects being 100% examination-based. Subjects either fit into the category of modular A-Levels or linear A-Levels. In modular subjects, students will take up to three exams in Year 12 and up to three in Year 13 whereas, with linear A-Levels, students complete all exams at the end of Year 13. How does this Pathway lead to University? A-Levels are internationally recognised qualifications which will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. While taking A-Levels would give you the necessary prerequisites with regards to subjects, you may need to take further tests in English in order to study at universities where courses are delivered in English. In addition, students wishing to study certain subjects worldwide need to review the Mathematics requirements for entry into the university of their choice. What skills will I develop? Taking a combination of A-Levels will allow you to specialise in a particular area post 16 as opposed to waiting until you begin university. With few subjects having coursework components, there is a lot of focus on exam skills. However, there is the option of taking the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in order to develop your academic writing and research skills. Furthermore, the EPQ is a perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate and develop your interest in an area you want to go on to study at university; competitive universities are always looking for examples of students pursuing their academic passions outside of the classroom. Whether it be the other EPQ or another opportunity, we recommend you find an outlet to explore your passions through extra-curricular activities."

Short for Business and Technology Education Council, BTECs are a practical-based, vocational qualification which offers the same equivalence to A-Levels when converted into UCAS points. Many industry sectors have a set of National Occupational Standards that professionals must follow. The learning content of BTECs is built around these National Occupational Standards, which is why BTECs are recognised as valuable qualifications. They provide the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a field or subject and are an excellent alternative to the more theory focused A-Levels or subjects on the IB Diploma Programme. What does this Pathway look like? BTECs are taught through application with students often going on educational visits and meeting industry specialists as well as completing one week of work experience in Year 12. Assessments are via regular coursework and projects throughout the 2-year course. If you know you don’t excel in exam conditions, BTECs can relieve this pressure, spreading out the work that dictates your final grade as 100% of your final grade will come from these coursework components. Students are able to take a combination of BTECs and A-Levels in order to have a balance between hands on learning whilst also taking more traditional subjects. How does this Pathway lead to University? BTECs are equivalent to A-Levels in terms of applications to universities. However, there are some universities which don’t accept these qualifications so you would need to research the different countries you would like to apply for in order to ensure you meet the admissions criteria for your desired destination. What skills will I develop? BTECs truly prepare students for the real world, offering them practical skills to be successful in the industry of their choosing. If you enjoy practical learning and want to study a specialised range of subjects, BTECs are the perfect option for you. Within each subject, more technical skills are developed; for example, we are very proud of our BTEC Media courses that allow students to create using hi-tech equipment as students learn how to get the most out of this technology."

Find out more about the details of the IB Diploma Programme at Sunmarke. What is the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme? The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is a holistic programme which gives you a broad post 16 education whilst also allowing you to specialise in three subjects. You will take three Standard Level subjects and three Higher Level subjects as well as the Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge and the Creativity, Activity and Service Programme (CAS). Each subject is graded from 1-7 with the diploma core (Theory of Knowledge and Extended Essay) giving 3 more points depending on the combination of grades in these components. Students must achieve a minimum total of 24 points to pass the Diploma Programme. What does this Pathway look like? Each week you will receive lessons in your 6 subjects (typically 4 lessons for higher level and 3 for standard level) as well as lessons in Theory of Knowledge (TOK). You will also receive sessions to develop writing and research skills needed for the Extended Essay. This is a piece of academic writing where you choose the subject, topic and research question to produce an answer in a 4,000 word research report. The CAS programme is a non-graded component which encourages students to set objectives in creative, active and service experiences outside of the classroom. Each subject has a coursework component worth at least 20% meaning the whole grade does not rest on the final exams. How does this Pathway lead to University? An internationally recognised qualification, the IBDP will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. With the DP developing more than just subject knowledge, universities see it as a perfect higher education preparation programme. As all students study English Language and Literature, you will meet the language requirement of most universities that deliver courses in English. The IBDP programme also continues a student’s study in Mathematics. Students completing the IBDP programme continue to study Mathematics and English throughout their Secondary education and are then able to demonstrate 4 years of study in Mathematics and English during the application process. The IB Diploma, due to its holistic nature and its requirements, is highly valued by universities worldwide. What skills will I develop? Through coursework components, the Extended Essay and Theory of Knowledge, you will learn to think critically, write well constructed, balanced arguments and write using an academic structure. The CAS programme develops skills to ensure you are a well-rounded student who has lots of experiences beyond the classroom to make you really stand out in university applications and interviews.

The IB Learner Profile is a set of traits which the IB believes students must develop to meet the mission’s long-term goal. Throughout the two years of the programme, teachers will promote these attributes in lessons to help students become better learners which will enhance their academic journey and prepare them to be more independent after graduating from school. Below are the 10 traits that make up the IB Learner Profile."

Students works closely with these experts and parents are always welcome to speak to our Careers and University team to find a pathway suitable for their child. Through conversations and research, students can find their calling and a pathway of study that excites and enthuses. Read below to see the different opportunities and platforms we use in order to help students get excited about education outside of the Sunmarke classrooms. UNIFROG Unifrog is the career and university platform that is used at Sunmarke School. It’s an impartial, user-friendly platform that helps students to research their future pathways. It contains a repository of career lessons, information on pathways, universities around the world, CV builder, personality tests, and links to MOOCs (online courses). Unifrog is useful for students in their last four years of study but can be accessed and used by all in Secondary. Students can use the platform to start to explore the different post 18 pathways and the application process for their chosen route. Careers lessons in Y12 focus on psychometric testing, university and career research and to start working on application requirements such as personal statements and US university essays. We encourage all families to explore this platform together as early as possible in order to start the conversation as to where a student may study as well as what the course requirements are in order to make sure the right combination of subjects are being chosen post 16. There are many factors that go into shortlisting universities such as location, size, tuition fees or university housing to name just a few; with all this choice, it is important to narrow down to specific countries in Year 12 so the application process is not overwhelming in Year 13. Students work one-on-one with the university careers counsellors who assist and guide students through every step of the application process. University Destinations Sunmarke students achieve their first choice university destinations which has included UK Russel Group schools, and top Worldwide destinations such as the Imperial College London, NYU, University of Amsterdam, Bocconi, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, UC San Diego, Georgia Tech, The University of Toronto, McGill and University of Edinburgh. For a full list of our destinations, click here . Offline University Guidance Parents are invited to join our ‘SunRise Sessions’ where they learn about different aspects of applying to universities around the world and get informed about the procedures and pathways. Our tailored programme of learning includes researching courses, writing personal statements, practising for aptitude tests and interviews, holding mock interviews and completing applications. We also host admissions teams from leading universities from around the world each year, giving students a unique opportunity to find out more about their courses and expectations.

As options for young people become more varied and complex, it is vital that we support them with knowledge and skills they need to make informed choices. As a result, the careers guidance has a whole-school remit designed to complement the rest of the school curriculum. This policy sets out how career activities are delivered at school and what stakeholders can expect. Aims and Objectives The careers guidance aims to: Encourage students to be ambitious, broaden their horizons and explore their own aspirations throughout their life at school Ensure students’ readiness to take their next step in their learning or career Help students to understand the changing world of work Facilitate meaningful encounters with potential employers Support positive transitions Post-16 and Post-18 Enable students to develop research skills Help them to develop the skills, attitudes and qualities to make a successful transition into the world of work Encourage participation in continued learning, including further and higher education Support inclusion, challenging stereotyping and promoting equality of opportunity Contribute to strategies for raising achievement, particularly by increasing motivation"

Age requirements will change for new students enroled into FS1, according to the UAE Ministry of Education Resolution no (24). Children enroling into FS1, starting in September, must be three years old on or before the 31st of August. Children enroling into FS2, starting in September, must be four years old on or before the 31st of August. Similarly, children enroling into Year 1, starting school in September, must be five years old on or before the 31st of August. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. This includes students who enrol for the final term of the 2023/24 academic year. Schools that start the academic year in September, in line with MOE Resolution no (24). Year Group Age requirement Foundation Stage 1 3 years old by August 31st Foundation Stage 2 4 years old by August 31st Year 1 5 years old by August 31 Year 2 6 years old by August 31 2. When did this change come into effect? This change was applicable from the start of the 2021/22 academic year in September 2021. 3. Why was this change made? This decision was made to bring more consistency to the cut-off dates used by schools in the UAE with those used by schools abroad. For example, UK schools in the UAE will now have the same cut-off date as schools in the UK, and international British schools. 4.Who will this change impact? This change will impact children up to six years old who are enrolling in school for the first time. 5. Will the new cut-off date apply to all year groups? It will apply to new students enrolling in FS1, FS2, Year 1 and Year 2 in all schools in the UAE, as stipulated in the MOE resolution. 6. My child was born in October and is now in FS1 – I want to enrol him in another school for FS2. Can I do this or does he have to repeat a year? Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year – before the changes come into effect – will she be able to start Year 1 next year? Yes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. 9. I’ve already registered and paid the deposit for my daughter to start school in FS2 in September. She will be four years old in November. Is she affected by this? According to the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution, your daughter will not be able to start in FS2 in September. Alternatively, we would be happy to transfer your child’s application to their age-appropriate year group (FS1) and register your child for this year group instead. Parents whose children are affected by the new cut-off dates and who have already paid deposits for their children’s enrolment are entitled to a refund if they wish. 10.

Our Achievement Centre offers a broad range of additional support for students with SEND, including targeted support in language, maths, literacy, and functional independence. We are currently working to develop our range of alternative curriculum pathways for Key Stages 2, 3, and 4 so that, in time, we can offer an appropriate pathway for every learner. What is Year 7 and Year 8 Life skills Pathway? 1. Is it approved by the Ministry of Education? It is a mainstream curriculum, supplemented by ASDAN modules. As it is a supplemented curriculum which focuses on reduced teachers, as per KHDA, there is no need for permission for this pathway as it falls under our current education licence. 2. What are the timings if my son is enroled in this program? The timings are that of the normal school day, unless the student has additional needs or commitments outside of school that need to be met. As a KHDA accredited Rahhal provider, we can review timings to meet the student’s needs. 3. What is the cost for LSA? Costs are an estimate range until all students are enroled. 4. What would be mentioned in the invoice for this program? Is it “Tuition fee”? School fees are billed as normal. Parents will then have to sign a KHDA Individual Service Agreement for the LSA cost. This will then be a separate invoice. 5 How will I enrol my child? Our SENCO will assess the student before we can accept to ensure we can meet their needs in this class. It is a pathway that supports access to the mainstream and we can’t cater for severe needs.

As industries transform, new careers emerge, and global competition rises, students need more than subject knowledge, they need the mindset, skills, and adaptability to thrive in a rapidly changing environment. This is where Career Readiness becomes essential. What Is Career Readiness? Career Readiness refers to the knowledge, skills, behaviours, and experiences students need to succeed in the workplace. It encompasses much more than choosing a career pathway, it’s about developing essential competencies that empower young people to make informed decisions, adapt to challenges, and pursue meaningful, successful careers. At its core, Career Readiness includes: Critical thinking and problem-solving Communication and collaboration Leadership and initiative Digital literacy and innovation Professionalism, work ethic, and adaptability Self-awareness and goal-setting Real-world exposure and experience When these skills are nurtured, students feel confident navigating their academic journeys and future career choices. Why Does Career Readiness Matter Today? A Rapidly Changing Job Market The careers students will step into tomorrow may not even exist today. Automation, AI, and technological advancements are reshaping industries at record speed. Career Readiness equips students to adapt, learn continuously, and remain competitive in this dynamic landscape. Bridging the Skills Gap Employers increasingly look for candidates who bring more than qualifications, they seek individuals with strong soft skills, creativity, emotional intelligence, and the ability to collaborate and think critically. Career Readiness programmes bridge this gap by equipping students with these highly sought-after competencies. Helping Students Make Informed Decisions With hundreds of pathways available, from university and vocational programmes to entrepreneurship, students can easily feel overwhelmed. Career Readiness provides clarity through career exploration, mentorship, and guidance, helping students understand their strengths and passions so they can choose the right path confidently. Building Confidence and Independence Through internships, workshops, leadership opportunities, and real-world projects, students gain hands-on experience that builds independence, resilience, and self-belief, qualities that stay with them for life. Fostering Future-Ready Leaders In an increasingly interconnected world, students must be global citizens who think beyond borders. Career Readiness nurtures leadership, empathy, communication, and cross-cultural understanding, skills essential for success in both further studies and the workplace. Career Readiness at Sunmarke At Sunmarke School, Career Readiness is woven into the fabric of our educational philosophy. Through our Careers Development Programme , students receive personalised guidance, access to industry experts, mentorship opportunities, university counselling, and immersive experiences that prepare them for future success. Whether through workshops, internships, Signature Programmes, or global exposure, we equip our students with everything they need to pursue their aspirations with confidence and clarity. Career Readiness is no longer optional, it is vital. By empowering students with the right skills, guidance, and experiences, we ensure they are not only prepared for the future but ready to shape it. At Sunmarke, we remain committed to developing future-ready learners who excel academically, grow personally, and lead with purpose in an ever-changing world. 0 Shares Prev Recent Blogs 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

As centres of learning and community, they can model the values and habits needed to care for our planet. At Sunmarke School, sustainability is not a stand-alone project; it’s embedded in our culture and daily life. Through our Environment and Sustainability Signature Programme, students across all year groups engage in practical, hands-on initiatives that promote environmental awareness, responsibility, and leadership. Education Beyond the Classroom At Sunmarke, sustainability is learned by doing. Students don’t just study environmental issues in the classroom; they take meaningful action to make a difference. Our Eco Warriors and Eco Committee play a central role in leading sustainability initiatives across the school. These include recycling through Recapp, ensuring plastic, cans, and paper are properly collected and reused, and the Hydroponics Project, which teaches students about sustainable food production. Sunlight Fridays encourage energy conservation by asking everyone to switch off classroom lights, while the Book Swap and newly launched Uniform Swap promote a culture of reuse, helping students exchange items that no longer fit or are no longer needed. Our Forest School sessions give younger learners the opportunity to connect directly with nature through outdoor exploration and environmental learning. These experiences help them develop respect for natural habitats, understand biodiversity, and see first-hand the importance of caring for living things. Through these initiatives, students gain a practical understanding of how small, consistent actions can contribute to a more sustainable world. Creating Greener Spaces and Sustainable Habits Sustainability at Sunmarke extends beyond individual projects to the way the school itself operates. Classrooms and corridors have dedicated recycling systems, which students monitor and maintain as part of their leadership roles. Green corners, composting projects, and the use of repurposed materials in Design Technology lessons show how sustainable thinking can be integrated into daily learning. In collaboration with our catering partners, Mastercook, students have also explored ways to make school dining more sustainable, from reducing food waste to improving recycling practices within the canteen. These efforts demonstrate that environmental responsibility can be built into every aspect of school life, encouraging students to think critically about the impact of their choices. Building a Community of Changemakers Sustainability thrives when it is supported by an engaged community. At Sunmarke, students, staff, and partners work together to create lasting impact. Our students represent the school in the Alliance for Sustainable Schools, take part in national and regional eco initiatives, and lead projects such as the BIC Pen Recycling Challenge, the Design a Reusable Cup Competition, and the Upcycle Challenge. Through these experiences, they learn that protecting the environment is not just an individual responsibility but a shared commitment. This collaborative approach strengthens our school’s community and shows that collective action is essential for meaningful change. Preparing Students for a Sustainable Future By making sustainability part of everyday school life, Sunmarke is preparing students to lead with purpose and innovation. Whether they are growing herbs in hydroponic stations, designing with recycled materials, or presenting environmental ideas to school leadership, students are developing the confidence, creativity, and compassion needed to shape a sustainable future. The Environment and Sustainability Signature Programme ensures that they leave Sunmarke not only with academic excellence but also with the mindset and values to become responsible global citizens. At Sunmarke, sustainability is more than a lesson; it’s a mindset. Together, our students are learning that small actions, when multiplied across a community, can create meaningful change for the planet. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

From automated journalism to AI-generated visuals and music, technology is reshaping the way content is created, shared, and consumed. For young creators today, this digital revolution opens up unprecedented opportunities to experiment, innovate, and make their voices heard. AI tools now allow creators to produce high-quality content with speed and precision. For instance, AI-powered video editing software can analyse hours of footage and suggest the best cuts, while AI music generators can compose original tracks in minutes. This not only reduces the technical barriers to entry but also encourages experimentation, allowing young creators to focus more on storytelling and creative expression. At Sunmarke, our Media Studies programme equips students with the skills to navigate these emerging tools, combining traditional media techniques with digital innovation. Students explore everything from video production and journalism to content strategy and social media management, preparing them to thrive in a rapidly evolving landscape. One of the most exciting aspects of AI in media is its potential to democratise content creation. In the past, producing high-quality films, podcasts, or digital campaigns often required significant resources and expertise. Today, AI tools can level the playing field, enabling students and young creators to produce professional-grade work with minimal cost. Sunmarke’s Media Studies curriculum emphasises hands-on projects where students can experiment with AI-assisted storytelling, from producing short films to creating multimedia campaigns for school events. This practical approach fosters creativity while teaching students how to leverage technology responsibly. Moreover, AI is changing the way audiences engage with content. Algorithms analyse user behaviour, suggesting personalised videos, articles, and music, which challenges creators to understand and adapt to audience preferences. Sunmarke’s Media Studies programme encourages students to study these trends critically, integrating lessons on media ethics, audience analysis, and digital literacy. By understanding both the creative and analytical sides of media, students can craft content that resonates while remaining mindful of the societal impact of AI-driven platforms. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

Through our Entrepreneurship and Enterprise curriculum , students are not only inspired to dream big but are equipped with the mindset, skills, and confidence to turn those dreams into reality. Nurturing the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs Our approach to enterprise education begins early. From primary years, students are introduced to the basics of creativity, innovation, and problem-solving through engaging, hands-on projects. As they move into secondary school and sixth form, these foundational experiences evolve into structured entrepreneurial challenges, student-led businesses, and enterprise showcases that mirror real-world business environments. Learning Through Real Experience Enterprise at Sunmarke is more than a subject; it’s an experience. Students take ownership of projects that align with their personal interests — whether it’s fashion, technology, sustainability, or social innovation. From ideation to pitching to a panel of industry mentors, they go through every stage of launching a venture. For example, students have developed eco-friendly product lines, organized fundraising events for global causes, and even created digital startups with real customers. These initiatives are supported by our dedicated mentors and industry partnerships, allowing students to experience the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship firsthand. Innovation Through Signature Programmes Enterprise education is seamlessly woven across our Signature Programmes , including STEAM & Design Thinking , Positive Education , and the Sunmarke Mini MBA . Students are encouraged to apply the principles of design thinking — empathizing, ideating, prototyping, and testing — to bring meaningful solutions to community and global issues. Our Positive Education Ethos ensures that students develop the emotional intelligence and growth mindset necessary to navigate uncertainty and lead with purpose. Pathways to Professional Success The skills developed through these enterprise projects extend far beyond school. Sunmarke graduates enter university and professional life with an entrepreneurial edge — equipped with communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills that employers and global institutions value. Whether they choose to become startup founders, social entrepreneurs, or leaders within established organisations, our students leave Sunmarke with the confidence and experience to make an impact — not just in their careers, but in the world around them. Empowering Passion, Inspiring Purpose At Sunmarke, we celebrate every student’s journey — from their first creative idea to their first successful project. Our goal is simple: to nurture changemakers who can transform their passions into professions and shape a brighter, more innovative future. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

From online research and digital classrooms to social media and gaming, screens have become an essential part of a teenager’s day. While technology has opened up incredible learning opportunities, it’s equally important to nurture healthy digital habits that promote balance, well-being, and academic success. At Sunmarke School, well-being is not just a subject, it’s a way of life. Through our Positive Education Ethos , we focus on developing students’ character strengths, emotional intelligence, and mindfulness to help them thrive in a digitally connected world. Understanding Digital Balance Sunmarke’s teaching approach integrates technology meaningfully into the curriculum. Students engage in blended learning environments using tools such as iPads, Google Classroom, and interactive digital platforms to enhance collaboration and creativity. However, we also teach the importance of moderation. Through our Well-being and Life Skills lessons , students learn to manage screen time consciously, understanding when technology adds value to their learning and when it’s time to switch off. Teachers regularly encourage “tech breaks” during lessons, giving students moments to refocus, move around, or engage in hands-on, real-world learning activities. This ensures that digital engagement supports, rather than overwhelms, their overall growth. The Power of Restful Sleep Sleep plays a vital role in memory, focus, and emotional well-being, especially for teenagers juggling academics, extracurriculars, and social connections. Yet, increased screen exposure, particularly before bedtime, can disrupt healthy sleep patterns. Sunmarke’s Positive Education and Well-being Framework helps students understand the science behind sleep and its connection to performance. Through activities such as mindfulness sessions, guided reflections, and digital detox challenges, students learn practical strategies to create healthy nighttime routines, such as reducing screen use an hour before bed, reading, or journalling instead. By embedding these lessons across the curriculum and in our Positive Education sessions , we empower students to make conscious choices that enhance both academic outcomes and mental health. Finding Focus: Study with Intention With the abundance of online resources available, students today have endless access to knowledge. But without proper boundaries, these same tools can lead to distractions and reduced productivity. At Sunmarke, we guide students to use technology as a tool for deep learning rather than shallow multitasking. Our teachers integrate metacognitive strategies – helping students plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning. Students are also encouraged to explore offline learning moments through reading, creative projects, and our signature STEAM & Design Thinking and Forest School programmes, which provide immersive, hands-on experiences away from screens. Empowering Teens to Thrive Digitally Our goal at Sunmarke is to raise responsible digital citizens, teenagers who understand that technology should empower, not consume, their lives. Through a blend of Positive Education , and Parent Well-being workshops, we work closely with families to foster balanced habits at home and at school. Parents are guided on how to model healthy screen use, set boundaries, and create environments where digital wellness is prioritised. In Conclusion In the digital world, balance is key. By integrating well-being, mindfulness, and purposeful technology use into every aspect of learning, Sunmarke ensures that our students grow not only as capable digital learners but also as resilient, self-aware individuals. At Sunmarke, we believe that when students learn to balance screen time, sleep, and study, they don’t just succeed academically – they truly thrive in life. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

At Sunmarke School, our Secondary programme within the British curriculum is designed to go beyond traditional methods, equipping students with the knowledge, skills, and values they need to thrive in university, careers, and life. A Rich and Rigorous British Curriculum Our Secondary students follow the highly respected British curriculum, which provides a strong academic foundation while encouraging independent thought and intellectual curiosity. From Key Stage 3 through to IGCSEs and A-Levels, pupils are challenged to achieve excellence across subjects, but learning is never limited to memorising facts. Instead, we place emphasis on enquiry, critical thinking, and real-world application. Every lesson begins with a ‘Big Question’ – a thought-provoking prompt that sparks curiosity, encourages communication, and sets the stage for inquiry-based learning. By regularly linking subjects together and embedding global and UAE contexts into lessons, students see the relevance of what they learn and make authentic connections to the world around them. Active, Student-Centred Learning We believe that students learn best when they are active participants in their education. Lessons are designed to be engaging, interactive, and personalised. Teachers use project-based learning, collaborative activities, debates, and experiments to make knowledge come alive. Activities are carefully differentiated to meet the needs of diverse learners, using flexible grouping strategies and modified tasks to support and challenge each student. This ensures that every learner can progress at their own pace, while also developing confidence to explore new ways of learning. Student choice and autonomy are encouraged, enabling pupils to take ownership of their learning while developing open-mindedness and resilience. Reflection is embedded in every stage, with students engaging in ‘React’ feedback —a written dialogue with teachers on assessed work—to reflect, set goals, and drive progress forward. Problem-solving, innovation, and enterprise are intrinsic parts of learning. Whether analysing a Shakespearean play through performance, applying mathematical concepts to real-life problems, or designing sustainable solutions in science and design projects, students develop mastery alongside creativity and adaptability. Harnessing Technology and Innovation In a digital age, technology plays a central role in our classrooms. At Sunmarke, we integrate state-of-the-art learning platforms, virtual reality experiences, and AI-powered tools to personalise education. These tools enable real-time monitoring of student progress, allowing teachers to adjust instruction to suit readiness, interest, and learning styles. Technology also supports metacognitive growth—helping students set goals, monitor their progress, and reflect on their thinking. This explicit focus on self-regulation ensures that students not only consume knowledge but also understand how they learn best. Building Skills for Life Beyond subject knowledge, our Secondary programme focuses on nurturing essential life skills such as communication, problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, and resilience. Students are encouraged to articulate their thought processes and reasoning, deepening their understanding while sharpening their ability to collaborate and persuade. Through opportunities like Model United Nations, TEDx events, enterprise challenges, and entrepreneurship initiatives, students learn to work strategically, innovate boldly, and articulate their ideas with confidence. These experiences prepare them to become adaptable and compassionate leaders in an interconnected world. A Holistic Education Ethos Sunmarke’s Positive Education ethos underpins everything we do. We balance academic achievement with wellbeing, character development, and values-based learning. From arts and sports to service projects and community initiatives, students are given opportunities to thrive beyond the classroom. Our ethos ensures a well-rounded education that fosters both excellence and empathy, shaping individuals who are not only successful but also grounded, compassionate, and future-ready. Preparing for the Future Our forward-thinking approach ensures students are well-prepared for life beyond school. Dedicated career guidance, personalised learning pathways, university preparation programmes, and exposure to industry leaders provide clarity about aspirations and next steps. By integrating rigorous academics, innovative pedagogy, cutting-edge technology, and a strong emphasis on wellbeing, Sunmarke students graduate with outstanding results, adaptability, and purpose—the qualities needed to thrive in an ever-changing world. At Sunmarke, Secondary education goes far beyond the textbook. By blending the rigour of the British curriculum with innovative teaching methods, personalised learning, metacognitive strategies, and a strong focus on wellbeing and character, we create an environment where students are inspired to think critically, act compassionately, and achieve boldly. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

We believe the most meaningful learning happens when students actively engage with real-world challenges, think critically, and apply their knowledge in practical ways. This is why STEAM education – Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics – is at the heart of our curriculum, blending creativity with problem-solving and academic rigour. One of the most impactful approaches we take in our STEAM provision is Design Thinking. This method allows students to creatively solve real-world problems with empathy, collaboration, and interdisciplinary skills that mirror how professionals innovate and make meaningful change. Why Projects Matter in STEAM Education In the British curriculum, a strong emphasis is placed on developing not just knowledge, but also critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. Projects bring these aims to life. Connecting theory to practice: A lesson on renewable energy becomes far more memorable when students design and build their own solar-powered car. Encouraging creativity: The ‘A’ in STEAM ensures that artistry and innovation are woven into problem-solving, whether through designing prototypes, coding interactive media, or using visual arts to present findings. Building resilience: Projects often involve trial and error, encouraging pupils to see mistakes as opportunities to refine and improve their ideas. Collaboration and leadership: Working in groups helps students practise teamwork, communication, and leadership – vital skills for university and future careers. Sunmarke’s Approach to STEAM Projects From Early Years through to Sixth Form , Sunmarke pupils take part in projects that are carefully designed to stretch their imagination while strengthening academic knowledge. In EYFS and Primary, children explore hands-on challenges such as building catapults, designing sustainable vehicles, constructing drone chassis, baking for Fairtrade and healthy eating while running a marketing enterprise, creating space rovers and rockets, and experimenting with zoetropes. In Secondary , students delve deeper into cross-disciplinary tasks. For example, they might design a sustainable home that integrates principles from science, technology, and design thinking, or create a digital animation that communicates a scientific concept to younger pupils. Students also shine on global platforms, such as Junk Kouture , where Sunmarke teams have achieved remarkable recognition by designing high-fashion outfits from recycled materials—blending sustainability, creativity, and engineering in a way that inspires peers around the world. At Sixth Form level, projects become even more sophisticated, aligning with GCSE, A-Level and BTEC coursework. Students often tackle real-world case studies, sometimes in partnership with external organisations or industry experts, preparing them for higher education and the workplace. Preparing Students for the Future Project-based STEAM learning aligns perfectly with the skills demanded by the 21st-century economy. Employers are increasingly seeking individuals who can innovate, adapt, and collaborate. By immersing pupils in real-life scenarios and encouraging them to think outside the box, Sunmarke equips students not only with academic excellence but also with the mindset to become future-ready leaders, creators, and problem-solvers. A Culture of Innovation At Sunmarke, projects aren’t an “add-on” but a core philosophy of learning. They showcase our commitment to Positive Education , where academic success is balanced with character development, wellbeing, and a spirit of innovation. By learning through doing, our students gain confidence in their abilities, pride in their achievements, and the courage to take on new challenges. In essence, Sunmarke’s STEAM projects bring learning to life. They transform abstract theories into tangible experiences, empower pupils to discover their passions, and prepare them to make meaningful contributions in an ever-changing world. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

But at Sunmarke School, we see it as much more. In the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), mathematics is about sparking curiosity, developing confidence, and laying the foundations for a lifetime of learning. Why Early Maths Matters Research shows that early mathematical understanding is a strong predictor of later academic achievement. While the British curriculum formally begins at Key Stage 1, the EYFS framework provides the vital preparation needed to ensure that children transition smoothly and confidently into it. In EYFS, children don’t just learn about numbers – they develop reasoning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition skills, all while making sense of the world around them in playful, meaningful ways. From spotting shapes in their environment to counting blocks during play, children quickly discover that maths is everywhere. At Sunmarke, teachers design experiences that encourage exploration, questioning, and experimentation. This hands-on approach ensures that mathematics feels engaging and relevant right from the start. Making Numbers Fun At Sunmarke, learning maths in EYFS extends beyond the classroom walls and into everyday routines, play, and imagination. For example: Role-play activities: Children might run a pretend shop, counting coins and giving change, or create a picnic in the play kitchen, making sure everyone has an equal share of food. Outdoor learning: Counting steps while climbing, spotting patterns in nature, or building with blocks to understand shapes and symmetry. Songs and rhymes: Classics like Five Little Ducks or One, Two, Buckle My Shoe use rhythm and repetition to help little learners remember number sequences. Storytelling: Stories such as The Very Hungry Caterpillar or Ten Little Superheroes bring abstract mathematical concepts to life in fun, relatable ways. Classroom routines: Tidy-up time becomes a maths opportunity when children organise pencils by colour or sort blocks by shape. Through these everyday experiences, children learn that maths is not something to fear but something to enjoy. Building Confidence and Independence A key principle of the EYFS framework is encouraging children to think critically and solve problems independently. Teachers act as facilitators, guiding pupils to explore solutions rather than providing them directly. For example, when dividing snacks during a pretend picnic, children experience the foundations of division in a natural and enjoyable way. By celebrating effort and progress – not just correct answers – we nurture resilience and confidence. This growth mindset is essential not only for mathematics but also for lifelong learning. Preparing for the Future The EYFS framework is carefully aligned with the British curriculum, ensuring that children develop the skills they need for a successful transition into Key Stage 1 and beyond. By making maths playful, interactive, and meaningful, Sunmarke helps children build both competence and confidence. Our aim is for every child to see numbers not as obstacles but as tools for discovery. With the right encouragement, little learners can develop a genuine love for mathematics and approach “big numbers” with excitement and curiosity. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

My child, Alfa, has benefited tremendously with the school’s various signature programmes, such as the Forest School and the STEAM programme. During our visit to the school’s STEAM showcase, Alfa, my child mentioned, showed what he had created with great interest. As parents we were fascinated by his learning journey, how he took the concept of catapult studied in Stone Age man to a full blown model with all the ways the catapult was used in hunting for food. Sunmarke encapsulates real and practical learning and engagement at its best. Mrs. Breman Parent, Sunmarke School “ My son’s learning from Sunmarke’s unbelievably creative Signature Programmes has been the hallmark of his growth at school.

At Sunmarke’s STEAM programme and Space-X, he tinkers, ideates and tries, fails, and tries and finally successfully makes products and solutions, learning perseverance and the patience that even if you fail, always keep trying till you succeed. Marianne Boushra Parent, Sunmarke School “ Children truly learn when they have fun and that is exactly what Sunmarke achieves daily in and out of the classroom. My child has shown his immense excitement about STEAM and constantly updates me about the progress of his projects. I love being able to see my child express his work and his learning journey. He is engaged, involved, and passionate, and he looks forward to going to school every day. Nura Al Gaddah Parent, Sunmarke School “ Sunmarke is an amazing school for students of all ages, with its state of the art campus, well behaved students, qualified faculty and efficient admin team.

This is the essence of Positive Education (PosEd). A scientifically-proven concept, PosEd is causing a paradigm shift in global education where parents, schools and governments realise the need to increase a child’s ‘wellbeing’ to raise his/her levels of ‘achievement’. PosEd brings together the science of Positive Psychology combined with the best teaching practices to enable individuals, schools, and communities to flourish, be resilient, creative, successful and happy. Sunmarke – A Character-Building School Multiple studies on the effects of PosEd testify that improved levels of a child’s wellbeing are associated with higher levels of academic engagement, social skills, optimism, behaviour, and fewer mental health-related issues. Positive Education – Sunmarke’s DNA Positive Education (PosEd) is not an additional subject at Sunmarke but it’s woven into the fabric of the international school’s culture and is reflected in all its activities and teaching mechanisms. Sunmarke’s teachers undergo an intense training programme before entering the classroom where they learn, live, teach and embed Positive Education. This is what our teachers say about the Positive Education training they receive at Sunmarke: “Where amazing happens. A motto that at first glance just appears to be some words to attract parents to send their children to Sunmarke school, almost like a gimmick. Over the past 3 days for me amazing did happen. The positive education training took me on a journey of self-discovery, showing me that changing my mindset can bring positive outcomes. I realized I have the power to make a difference in people’s lives. This training was the best I’ve ever received from a school, as they genuinely cared about us, ensuring we could apply what we learned in teaching and at home. It was an incredible experience, especially since I used to dislike training due to its lack of usefulness. This was entirely different – truly helpful, purposeful, and enlightening. It taught me to believe in the potential of education to inspire change.” “The breadth of knowledge, evidence-based theories, outstanding coordination and delivery, and just everything about this week was outstanding! I was blown away in every way possible and feel so supported, valued, and appreciated.” The ‘Flourish’ Model The 6 Key Skills Practised and Taught by Sunmarke Teachers for Students to Incorporate in Their Lives SUNMARKE'S WELLBEING & COUNSELLING TEAM Our PosEd and wellbeing approach fosters deep trust in our school community, creating a safe, welcoming and nurturing environment. We embed various initiatives into the daily routines, curriculum and extracurricular activities to establish a personal, social and academic support system each child needs to flourish. Class and Form Tutors, Heads of Year, and Subject teachers support students every day through direct teaching, mentoring, workshops and assemblies. The Counselling Department provides compassionate care for children who may require professional support and or simply a sympathetic listening ear. Students and parents both have access to a School Counsellor. A ‘Wellbeing Champion’ represents the school leadership in our Parent Association and ‘Friends of Sunmarke School’ (FOSS) group while the popular monthly ‘Wellness Wednesday’ event raises awareness among parents about crucial topics like strength-based parenting, raising children in the digital age and health and nutrition.

Having joined Regent International School in Year 5 and later transitioning to Sunmarke in Year 7, I’ve had the unique experience of growing within the Fortes Education family from the very start. Attending Sunmarke from 2017 to 2025 shaped me in countless ways—academically, socially, and personally. I’m especially grateful for the friendships I’ve built, the guidance of inspiring teachers, and the opportunities that allowed me to grow and thrive. One of the highlights of my school journey was joining the swimming tryouts and trainings at Regent and continuing that pursuit at Sunmarke. That experience not only pushed me to grow physically and mentally but also taught me discipline and perseverance. As I now begin my next chapter studying Marketing at the University of Birmingham Dubai , I carry with me the lessons, values, and unforgettable memories that Regent and Sunmarke have given me. 0 Shares Prev Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

From exploring over 20 subjects to immersing myself in music and the performing arts, I’ve grown not just academically, but personally and creatively. Music has always been a guiding force in my life—starting piano at the age of five and serving as lead pianist at the Dubai Evangelical Church taught me the value of creativity, discipline, and connection. In my final year, I had the privilege of serving as Deputy Head Boy , a role that allowed me to give back to the school community in a meaningful way. I worked to encourage a positive, enthusiastic learning environment and focused on supporting the performing arts—creating more space for students to explore their talents and passions. Sunmarke has been an inspiring place where I was encouraged to learn, lead, and grow. As I begin my next chapter studying Engineering at the University of Toronto , I carry with me the values, confidence, and curiosity that were nurtured here.

Moving to Dubai at the age of 9 with little English was a challenge, but over the years, both this city and Sunmarke became my second home. Serving as Secondary Head Girl in my final year was an honour I embraced with great pride. From leading student initiatives and representing the school to playing on the football, volleyball, and netball teams, the year was filled with unforgettable experiences. I also had the privilege of working alongside an inspiring team of student leaders, and together we created lasting memories and meaningful impact. Looking back—from being Primary Head Girl in Year 6 to stepping into the role again in Sixth Form—I feel immense gratitude for how far I’ve come. Sunmarke has provided me with countless opportunities to lead, grow, and thrive, both inside and outside the classroom. As I begin my next chapter studying Biomedical Sciences at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden , I carry with me the resilience, leadership, and values instilled in me at Sunmarke. This school has shaped who I am, and I’ll always be proud to call it home. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

My goal was always to represent the student voice and make a meaningful contribution to school life. I had the privilege of working closely with the student leadership team on initiatives that supported wellbeing, amplified student feedback, and enhanced key school events. One of my proudest achievements was helping to strengthen communication between students and staff, ensuring that ideas and concerns were genuinely heard. On a personal note, returning to football after injury and continuing to pursue my passions in media and music were defining moments in my school journey. Above all, I remained committed, hardworking, and proud to serve. I’m now excited to begin a new chapter at the University of Leeds , where I’ll be studying Photography and Media . My experiences at Sunmarke-especially in leadership, creativity, and communication-have equipped me with the confidence and skills I’ll carry forward into university and beyond. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Attending Sunmarke from 2018 to 2020 was one of the most formative and exciting chapters of my life, and I’m forever grateful for the foundation it gave me. Achieving Excellence at Sunmarke I left Sunmarke with Straight A* and A grades in my A Levels and a BTEC Media Diploma. The combination of these qualifications equipped me with the skills and confidence I needed to take my next step: enrolling at Cardiff University. In 2020, I began studying Business Administration and Marketing, a course that perfectly matched my interests and ambitions. University Years and Beyond Graduating in 2023 with a 2:1 was a proud moment, marking the end of an incredible journey in the UK. But my heart was always drawn back to Dubai, so in the autumn of 2023, I returned home, eager to begin my career in the dynamic world of Business Development. Breaking into the Business World By November 2023, I had secured my first professional role as a Business Development Manager at KPS, a renowned interior fit-out and design company based in Dubai Design District. This opportunity has been nothing short of amazing. Every day, I learn something new—procurement, logistics, pricing strategies, customer relations, and even brand identity. I feel incredibly fortunate to work in such a creative and fast-paced environment where I can apply everything I’ve learned and continue to grow. Reflections on Sunmarke Looking back, what stands out most about my time at Sunmarke is the exceptional support I received from my teachers. They genuinely cared about my success and always encouraged me to aim high. The small class sizes made a huge difference too—it felt personal, like everyone was invested in my journey. The facilities were outstanding, and the sense of kindness and camaraderie among students and staff made it a joy to come to school every day. Advice for Current Sunmarke Students If I could give one piece of advice to students preparing to enter the professional world, it would be this: expect to learn a lot. The transition from school to the workplace is full of opportunities to grow and develop, so work hard, stay humble, and be grateful for every experience. Most importantly, never miss a chance to make something better—whether it’s your work, a process, or even someone’s day. Looking Ahead As I look to the future, my ultimate goal is to grow into the role of CEO and lead a company to its greatest possible success. I’m passionate about watching businesses thrive, and I can’t wait to see where my journey takes me next. Thank You, Sunmarke Sunmarke School will always hold a special place in my heart. It’s where my ambitions were born, my skills were nurtured, and my path to success was set. Thank you for being the launchpad for my dreams—I wouldn’t be where I am today without you. To all the students at Sunmarke now: the sky’s the limit. Dream big, work hard, and make every moment count. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

I completed my A-Levels in Biology, Chemistry, and Maths, achieving an A* in all three subjects, an A in AS Level Psychology and an A in my Extended Project Qualification. I joined Sunmarke in 2021 at the start of Year 12 after completing my IB MYP exams at a previous school. My time at Sunmarke has been invaluable; the teachers were incredibly supportive, guiding me through everything from academic content to my EPQ and university applications. I also appreciated the numerous spaces within the school that allowed me to connect with friends and classmates. Currently, I am pursuing Medicine and Surgery at Humanitas University in Milan, Italy. My ultimate career goal is to specialize in a specific medical field, and I anticipate discovering my passion during my hospital rotations in my third year. To current Sunmarke students, I would say: As you transition into the professional world, remember that growth often comes with challenges. Initially, navigating independently can be tough, but it becomes easier with time. School is just the first chapter of your journey, but it’s a crucial one in achieving your aspirations. The lessons you learn now will pave the way for your future success. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

I graduated from the school in 2017 after completing my Maths, Physics and Business A-Levels, achieving A*’s in all three subjects. This landed me an offer at the University of Exeter, studying MEng Renewable Energy Engineering on their Cornwall campus. At University, I spent the best 4 years of my life. I learnt all about solar, wind, tidal, and wave energy technologies which made me realise the importance of my degree for our future. This encouraged me to work as a student ambassador for the University, alongside my studies, to encourage other students to study STEM subjects. Living and studying in Cornwall has also been a unique experience as I was surrounded by greenery and the sea. After graduating from the University of Exeter with a First Class Honours in 2021, I was offered a job as a Graduate Engineer at Photon Energy in Reading, UK. I have recently been promoted to an Assistant Engineer, working on the design of commercial rooftop PV systems for large companies in the UK. I have been involved in some of the company’s biggest projects for large food distributors, going on site visits and assisting the delivery of the projects. One of my biggest achievements is the respect and trust I have earned from my colleagues and directors as a result of my hard work and commitment. Throughout my education and work experience, I have grown as an individual as I became more independent. This was influenced by the encouragement I received from my teachers at Sunmarke school who always believed in me and pushed me to apply to University in the UK. In the future, as I gain more experience, I would like to progress to become a project manager, working on large-scale rooftop and ground-mount PV systems around the World. If I could summarise the lessons I learnt throughout my adult life so far, I would emphasise the importance of believing in oneself and stepping outside the comfort zone because this is the only way to find our limits and accomplish our dreams. 0 Shares Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

With over 40 years of Early Years excellence, JINS Early Childhood Centre provides an inspiring British education that nurtures the hearts and minds of children aged 45+ days old and sparks infinite potential in all our little learners. Nursery School in Dubai Areas of Learning JINS’ unique educational framework blends the World-Class British EYFS Curriculum with Reggio-Emilia, The Curiosity Approach and Montessori principles to bring hands-on learning experiences to life. Our curriculum is further enriched with STEAM and Positive Education to set the stage for an exciting journey of discovery. Our Early Years Experts create authentic and meaningful learning experiences that embrace the individuality of each child, allowing them to progress and flourish based on their unique interests, abilities and aptitude. These seven areas of learning are essential for your child’s healthy development and form the core framework of our educational programmes: 3 Core Areas of Learning Physical Development Communication and Language Personal, Social and Emotional Development 4 Specific Areas of Learning Literacy Mathematics Understanding of the World Expressive Arts and Design Extraordinary Indoor & Outdoor Spaces With 9 vibrant branches in Dubai, JINS provides rich learning environments that ignite children’s imagination and stimulate endless moments of discovery and exploration. Our nature-inspired Early Childhood Centre in the heart of the JVT community offers stimulating and engaging spaces where every detail is crafted to inspire and nurture young minds. Children at JINS Sunmarke, JVT, have access to large, Reggio-inspired classrooms and a shared courtyard to which all classroom doors open, making it a welcoming space where children explore through sensory and physical play whilst also forging a strong connection with nature through our outdoor mud kitchen and garden areas. Learning Through Play Our passionate educators create joy-filled learning experiences where children ‘learn through play’ and hands-on activities that enhance their understanding and comprehension of the world around them. Our open-ended Reggio-inspired learning resources encourage creativity and problem-solving and enable our children to become confident and independent little learners. Outstanding Care The wellbeing of our children and families is at the heart of what we do. We’re committed to exceeding and maintaining the highest international standards of quality and safety in early childhood education. We are proud holders of the ISO 9001 Certification (Quality Systems) and are the only Nursery in the UAE with the ISO 21001 (Education Systems) Certification. At JINS, we follow the below rigorous health and safety procedures at our Early Childhood Centres: Clean, fresh, and sanitised learning environments Child-friendly changing facilities and toilets located within the classroom Inculcating children with practices of good hygiene throughout the day A full-time nurse on site Doctor visits twice a week Stringent security measures with identifiable lanyards for all adults (parents/visitors/staff) to wear at all times Security gates surrounding the nursery externally and internally All families are invited for a staggered entry week allowing a smooth and steady start for children Transition to Big School At JINS JVT, we help our children develop and secure skills which will be essential for a smooth transition into EYFS at Sunmarke School at the age of 3. We support our young learners as they develop pre-writing and literacy skills and build their knowledge of important mathematical concepts through play and exploration. Children learn how to identify and write their own names and are introduced to the Letters and Sounds and Accelerated Maths Programme. On a day-to-day basis, the children are encouraged to be independent, think critically, ask questions, and use their imagination as they learn and explore together. In addition to this, our children regularly go across and experience the learning spaces in EYFS at Sunmarke School in the Summer Term, allowing them to acclimatise to new environments, practitioners, peers, routines, and levels of expectation. During these ‘Transition Days’ children experience the Forest Schools in EYFS at both schools, visit the libraries and play spaces, and enjoy specialised lessons such as Physical Education and Music. The JINS Family Club We believe that Early Childhood Centres are more important than ever before. As well as being crucial years for your child’s development and preparation for life in the modern world, it’s also a place for families to come together and feel supported. Our parents can become a member of the JINS Family Club where they’ll have access to expert speakers and interactive workshops aimed at supporting you on your parenting journey. Follow the JINS Family Club Instagram Page here.

With over 40 years of Early Years excellence, JINS Early Childhood Centre provides an inspiring British education that nurtures the hearts and minds of children aged 45+ days old and sparks infinite potential in all our little learners. Nursery School in Dubai Areas of Learning JINS’ unique educational framework blends the World-Class British EYFS Curriculum with Reggio-Emilia, The Curiosity Approach and Montessori principles to bring hands-on learning experiences to life. Our curriculum is further enriched with STEAM and Positive Education to set the stage for an exciting journey of discovery. Our Early Years Experts create authentic and meaningful learning experiences that embrace the individuality of each child, allowing them to progress and flourish based on their unique interests, abilities and aptitude. These seven areas of learning are essential for your child’s healthy development and form the core framework of our educational programmes: 3 Core Areas of Learning Physical Development Communication and Language Personal, Social and Emotional Development 4 Specific Areas of Learning Literacy Mathematics Understanding of the World Expressive Arts and Design Extraordinary Indoor & Outdoor Spaces With 9 vibrant branches in Dubai, JINS provides rich learning environments that ignite children’s imagination and stimulate endless moments of discovery and exploration. Our nature-inspired Early Childhood Centre in the heart of the JVT community offers stimulating and engaging spaces where every detail is crafted to inspire and nurture young minds. Children at JINS Sunmarke, JVT, have access to large, Reggio-inspired classrooms and a shared courtyard to which all classroom doors open, making it a welcoming space where children explore through sensory and physical play whilst also forging a strong connection with nature through our outdoor mud kitchen and garden areas. Learning Through Play Our passionate educators create joy-filled learning experiences where children ‘learn through play’ and hands-on activities that enhance their understanding and comprehension of the world around them. Our open-ended Reggio-inspired learning resources encourage creativity and problem-solving and enable our children to become confident and independent little learners. Outstanding Care The wellbeing of our children and families is at the heart of what we do. We’re committed to exceeding and maintaining the highest international standards of quality and safety in early childhood education. We are proud holders of the ISO 9001 Certification (Quality Systems) and are the only Nursery in the UAE with the ISO 21001 (Education Systems) Certification. At JINS, we follow the below rigorous health and safety procedures at our Early Childhood Centres: Clean, fresh, and sanitised learning environments Child-friendly changing facilities and toilets located within the classroom Inculcating children with practices of good hygiene throughout the day A full-time nurse on site Doctor visits twice a week Stringent security measures with identifiable lanyards for all adults (parents/visitors/staff) to wear at all times Security gates surrounding the nursery externally and internally All families are invited for a staggered entry week allowing a smooth and steady start for children Transition to Big School At JINS JVT, we help our children develop and secure skills which will be essential for a smooth transition into EYFS at Sunmarke School at the age of 3. We support our young learners as they develop pre-writing and literacy skills and build their knowledge of important mathematical concepts through play and exploration. Children learn how to identify and write their own names and are introduced to the Letters and Sounds and Accelerated Maths Programme. On a day-to-day basis, the children are encouraged to be independent, think critically, ask questions, and use their imagination as they learn and explore together. In addition to this, our children regularly go across and experience the learning spaces in EYFS at Sunmarke School in the Summer Term, allowing them to acclimatise to new environments, practitioners, peers, routines, and levels of expectation. During these ‘Transition Days’ children experience the Forest Schools in EYFS at both schools, visit the libraries and play spaces, and enjoy specialised lessons such as Physical Education and Music. The JINS Family Club We believe that Early Childhood Centres are more important than ever before. As well as being crucial years for your child’s development and preparation for life in the modern world, it’s also a place for families to come together and feel supported. Our parents can become a member of the JINS Family Club where they’ll have access to expert speakers and interactive workshops aimed at supporting you on your parenting journey. Follow the JINS Family Club Instagram Page here.

Children at JINS Sunmarke, JVT, have access to large, Reggio-inspired classrooms and a shared courtyard to which all classroom doors open, making it a welcoming space where children explore through sensory and physical play whilst also forging a strong connection with nature through our outdoor mud kitchen and garden areas. Learning Through Play Our passionate educators create joy-filled learning experiences where children ‘learn through play’ and hands-on activities that enhance their understanding and comprehension of the world around them. Our open-ended Reggio-inspired learning resources encourage creativity and problem-solving and enable our children to become confident and independent little learners. Outstanding Care The wellbeing of our children and families is at the heart of what we do. We’re committed to exceeding and maintaining the highest international standards of quality and safety in early childhood education. We are proud holders of the ISO 9001 Certification (Quality Systems) and are the only Nursery in the UAE with the ISO 21001 (Education Systems) Certification. At JINS, we follow the below rigorous health and safety procedures at our Early Childhood Centres: Clean, fresh, and sanitised learning environments Child-friendly changing facilities and toilets located within the classroom Inculcating children with practices of good hygiene throughout the day A full-time nurse on site Doctor visits twice a week Stringent security measures with identifiable lanyards for all adults (parents/visitors/staff) to wear at all times Security gates surrounding the nursery externally and internally All families are invited for a staggered entry week allowing a smooth and steady start for children Transition to Big School At JINS JVT, we help our children develop and secure skills which will be essential for a smooth transition into EYFS at Sunmarke School at the age of 3. We support our young learners as they develop pre-writing and literacy skills and build their knowledge of important mathematical concepts through play and exploration. Children learn how to identify and write their own names and are introduced to the Letters and Sounds and Accelerated Maths Programme. On a day-to-day basis, the children are encouraged to be independent, think critically, ask questions, and use their imagination as they learn and explore together. In addition to this, our children regularly go across and experience the learning spaces in EYFS at Sunmarke School in the Summer Term, allowing them to acclimatise to new environments, practitioners, peers, routines, and levels of expectation. During these ‘Transition Days’ children experience the Forest Schools in EYFS at both schools, visit the libraries and play spaces, and enjoy specialised lessons such as Physical Education and Music. The JINS Family Club We believe that Early Childhood Centres are more important than ever before. As well as being crucial years for your child’s development and preparation for life in the modern world, it’s also a place for families to come together and feel supported. Our parents can become a member of the JINS Family Club where they’ll have access to expert speakers and interactive workshops aimed at supporting you on your parenting journey.

Children acquire new skills through 7 areas of learning and development. In the initial stages, three Prime Areas are in focus: Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language Development. Growing up, the Prime Areas help develop skills in 4 Specific Areas: Literacy Mathematics Understanding of the World Expressive Arts and Design Laying the Foundations for Lifelong Learning in FS1 and FS2 At Sunmarke, our Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), comprising FS1 (Nursery) and FS2 (Reception) , offers a broad, balanced, and enriching curriculum for children aged 3 to 5. Rooted in the British curriculum and recognised as one of Dubai’s leading EYFS providers, our programme nurtures each child’s unique strengths and interests through play-based, inquiry-led learning. A Curriculum Designed Around the Whole Child The EYFS curriculum at FS1 and FS2 is structured around seven key areas of learning and development: Prime Areas (Early Focus): Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language These areas are particularly emphasised in FS1 , helping our youngest learners develop the essential foundations of confidence, relationships, movement, and communication. Specific Areas (Building on the Foundations): Literacy Mathematics Understanding the World Expressive Arts and Design As children progress into FS2 , these specific areas become more prominent, supporting emerging literacy and numeracy skills, creative expression, and a growing awareness of the world. Characteristics of Effective Learning Across FS1 and FS2, we recognise that children learn in different ways. The EYFS framework promotes three key learning characteristics: Playing and Exploring: Investigating and experiencing, ‘having a go’ Active Learning: Concentrating, persevering, and celebrating achievement Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing ideas, making connections, and problem-solving These traits guide how learning is planned and delivered across both FS1 and FS2, ensuring that each child’s development is supported in a way that reflects their interests, needs, and learning styles. Learning Through Play and Projects At Sunmarke, we view play as a powerful vehicle for learning in both FS1 and FS2. Our curriculum is intentionally designed to offer rich, purposeful play experiences that allow children to explore, imagine, and make sense of the world in a way that is meaningful to them. In FS1 , children are encouraged to investigate through hands-on exploration, sensory play, and open-ended experiences that develop early communication, social, and physical skills. As they transition into FS2 , children engage in more structured yet still playful learning that builds early literacy and numeracy skills while continuing to promote creativity and curiosity. Our project-based learning approach further enhances engagement. Each term, both FS1 and FS2 children explore exciting, inquiry-led themes such as “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Somewhere Out There,” and “Up, Up and Away.” These projects spark imagination and are shaped by the children’s own interests and questions, creating a deep sense of ownership and wonder. Whether FS1 children are building a fairy tale castle or FS2 pupils are investigating the planets, our environments are carefully curated to provide challenge, joy, and discovery. Through child-initiated and adult-guided activities, children develop critical thinking, collaboration, and communication—the building blocks of future learning. A Holistic and Nurturing Approach At Sunmarke, we believe that every child in FS1 and FS2 is a unique individual. Our holistic approach to early education goes beyond academics to nurture each child’s emotional, social, physical, and intellectual development. We incorporate globally respected early years methodologies including elements of the Reggio Emilia philosophy , Montessori principles , and the Curiosity Approach . This eclectic framework values child-led exploration, independence, and a strong connection to the learning environment—creating rich opportunities for discovery and expression. Our learning spaces are thoughtfully designed to be calm, beautiful, and engaging, reflecting the importance of the environment as the ‘third teacher’. Teachers and support staff observe closely, respond sensitively, and plan responsively to extend learning in authentic, meaningful ways. Strong partnerships with parents, a passionate team of educators, and a shared belief in the limitless potential of every child create a warm, supportive community. In FS1 and FS2, children feel safe, seen, and inspired—laying a confident foundation for their journey through school and life. Characteristics of Effective Learning The characteristics of Effective Learning describe how children learn and respond to teaching in the Foundation Stage, a factor determined by their individual learning characteristic. Three traits of effective teaching and learning identified by the EYFS are: Playing and Exploring: Finding out, discovering, willing to ‘have a go’ and playing with what they know Active Learning: Being involved and concentrating, trying and persevering, taking pleasure from achievements Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing their own ideas, making links and selecting their own ways to complete tasks 7 Curriculum Areas To enhance the learning experience and make it impactful, Sunmarke has selected 7 curriculum areas taught through unique projects and interests, most of which are child-initiated activities that incorporate elements of imagination, investigation and ‘out of the box’ ideas, concepts and solutions. The EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play which enhances critical thinking abilities, fuels risk-taking and creative skills. Examples of topics are ‘I believe I can fly’, ‘Somewhere out there’ and ‘Up up and away.’ The initiative EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play. Our teaching philosophy is designed to treat all children as unique individuals in their own right. Our holistic approach towards education ensures that parents/carers, class teachers, specialist teachers and learning assistants work very effectively together to support our firm belief that ‘every child is unique’. Our maxim is that happy and well-motivated children are good learners. The Foundation Stage is a safe, secure and friendly environment for our youngest children to gain confidence and independence, as they prepare for the next stage of schooling. It is a foundation for future learning. Characteristics of Effective Learning (CoEL) are a revived element in the current Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum (EYFS). CoEL advocates that while planning and guiding children’s activities, practitioners must reflect on the different ways that students learn, and these lessons must be reflected in their practice."

N – Nurture: We nurture every child to enable them to grow and reach their fullest potential. G – Grow: Every child that enters EYFS has a special and incredible journey that helps them grow and develop into happy, healthy teens. Learning Through Play Imaginative and creative play is how children learn about the world. During imaginative play, they manipulate materials, express themselves verbally and non-verbally, plan, act, interact, react and try different roles. Learning is most effective when children participate in creative play with dolls, vehicles, blocks, rocks, cardboard, or boxes. Employing creative thinking while manipulating play dough, creating recipes by mixing dirt and water, working with art materials, splashing in puddles, or pretending to fly can further child development. Imagination fosters cognitive and social development by allowing children to contemplate different resolutions, thus boosting their self-confidence. Our Early Years Foundation Stage has been rated as ‘ Outstanding ’ in the latest KHDA’s DSIB inspection report (2023-24) with ‘ Outstanding Personal Development & Learning Skills and Outstanding Curriculum and Curriculum Adaptation’."

Children acquire new skills through 7 areas of learning and development. In the initial stages, three Prime Areas are in focus: Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language Development. Growing up, the Prime Areas help develop skills in 4 Specific Areas: Literacy Mathematics Understanding of the World Expressive Arts and Design Laying the Foundations for Lifelong Learning in FS1 and FS2 At Sunmarke, our Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), comprising FS1 (Nursery) and FS2 (Reception) , offers a broad, balanced, and enriching curriculum for children aged 3 to 5. Rooted in the British curriculum and recognised as one of Dubai’s leading EYFS providers, our programme nurtures each child’s unique strengths and interests through play-based, inquiry-led learning. A Curriculum Designed Around the Whole Child The EYFS curriculum at FS1 and FS2 is structured around seven key areas of learning and development: Prime Areas (Early Focus): Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Communication and Language These areas are particularly emphasised in FS1 , helping our youngest learners develop the essential foundations of confidence, relationships, movement, and communication. Specific Areas (Building on the Foundations): Literacy Mathematics Understanding the World Expressive Arts and Design As children progress into FS2 , these specific areas become more prominent, supporting emerging literacy and numeracy skills, creative expression, and a growing awareness of the world. Characteristics of Effective Learning Across FS1 and FS2, we recognise that children learn in different ways. The EYFS framework promotes three key learning characteristics: Playing and Exploring: Investigating and experiencing, ‘having a go’ Active Learning: Concentrating, persevering, and celebrating achievement Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing ideas, making connections, and problem-solving These traits guide how learning is planned and delivered across both FS1 and FS2, ensuring that each child’s development is supported in a way that reflects their interests, needs, and learning styles. Learning Through Play and Projects At Sunmarke, we view play as a powerful vehicle for learning in both FS1 and FS2. Our curriculum is intentionally designed to offer rich, purposeful play experiences that allow children to explore, imagine, and make sense of the world in a way that is meaningful to them. In FS1 , children are encouraged to investigate through hands-on exploration, sensory play, and open-ended experiences that develop early communication, social, and physical skills. As they transition into FS2 , children engage in more structured yet still playful learning that builds early literacy and numeracy skills while continuing to promote creativity and curiosity. Our project-based learning approach further enhances engagement. Each term, both FS1 and FS2 children explore exciting, inquiry-led themes such as “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Somewhere Out There,” and “Up, Up and Away.” These projects spark imagination and are shaped by the children’s own interests and questions, creating a deep sense of ownership and wonder. Whether FS1 children are building a fairy tale castle or FS2 pupils are investigating the planets, our environments are carefully curated to provide challenge, joy, and discovery. Through child-initiated and adult-guided activities, children develop critical thinking, collaboration, and communication—the building blocks of future learning. A Holistic and Nurturing Approach At Sunmarke, we believe that every child in FS1 and FS2 is a unique individual. Our holistic approach to early education goes beyond academics to nurture each child’s emotional, social, physical, and intellectual development. We incorporate globally respected early years methodologies including elements of the Reggio Emilia philosophy , Montessori principles , and the Curiosity Approach . This eclectic framework values child-led exploration, independence, and a strong connection to the learning environment—creating rich opportunities for discovery and expression. Our learning spaces are thoughtfully designed to be calm, beautiful, and engaging, reflecting the importance of the environment as the ‘third teacher’. Teachers and support staff observe closely, respond sensitively, and plan responsively to extend learning in authentic, meaningful ways. Strong partnerships with parents, a passionate team of educators, and a shared belief in the limitless potential of every child create a warm, supportive community. In FS1 and FS2, children feel safe, seen, and inspired—laying a confident foundation for their journey through school and life. Characteristics of Effective Learning The characteristics of Effective Learning describe how children learn and respond to teaching in the Foundation Stage, a factor determined by their individual learning characteristic. Three traits of effective teaching and learning identified by the EYFS are: Playing and Exploring: Finding out, discovering, willing to ‘have a go’ and playing with what they know Active Learning: Being involved and concentrating, trying and persevering, taking pleasure from achievements Creating and Thinking Critically: Developing their own ideas, making links and selecting their own ways to complete tasks 7 Curriculum Areas To enhance the learning experience and make it impactful, Sunmarke has selected 7 curriculum areas taught through unique projects and interests, most of which are child-initiated activities that incorporate elements of imagination, investigation and ‘out of the box’ ideas, concepts and solutions. The EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play which enhances critical thinking abilities, fuels risk-taking and creative skills. Examples of topics are ‘I believe I can fly’, ‘Somewhere out there’ and ‘Up up and away.’ The initiative EYFS curriculum is designed and based on the philosophy of learning through play. Our teaching philosophy is designed to treat all children as unique individuals in their own right. Our holistic approach towards education ensures that parents/carers, class teachers, specialist teachers and learning assistants work very effectively together to support our firm belief that ‘every child is unique’. Our maxim is that happy and well-motivated children are good learners. The Foundation Stage is a safe, secure and friendly environment for our youngest children to gain confidence and independence, as they prepare for the next stage of schooling. It is a foundation for future learning. Characteristics of Effective Learning (CoEL) are a revived element in the current Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum (EYFS). CoEL advocates that while planning and guiding children’s activities, practitioners must reflect on the different ways that students learn, and these lessons must be reflected in their practice."

We do this by empowering our students through an innovative and character-building education that inspires them to thrive and achieve with purpose. Our curriculum design serves to reflect this. Whilst maintaining academic rigour through the British National Curriculum, our holistic Positive Education ethos and ambitious commitment to innovative technology ensures our children achieve outstanding academic, social and personal success. Additionally, opportunities for Forest School lessons and outdoor learning are provided to all Primary students. Therefore, the drivers for our curriculum are based on two principles: all learning is purposeful with real-life application and context; and students can make connections across interdisciplinary skills. STEAM With the opening of our dedicated STEAM Centre, SPACE-X, and the addition of specialist resident design technology and computing teachers, we have redesigned our curriculum to take us from our thematic roots to design thinking, using the Stanford d.school approach below. Whilst English and maths remain explicitly on the timetable, children work on STEAM theme projects across science, design technology, engineering, the arts, maths and humanities, with the option to also make purposeful links to our UAE moral, social and cultural studies and Values in Action objectives . Living in the UAE, it is vital we also make purposeful links to our local surroundings, Islamic culture and Arabic language. This hands-on approach to problem-solving enables each STEAM theme to culminate in a proposed project which requires the students to design/make/create something which draws upon the knowledge and skills which they have learnt over the course of the project . During each STEAM project , each class will spend two weeks in SPACE-X, where the support of our specialists will enable children’s designs to come to life.

Seamless Transition Sunmarke Secondary School ensures that students have a smooth transition from Primary to Secondary school to succeed in the next phase of their academic journey. To make the experience less daunting, our staff works closely with families. Our transition programme from Primary to Secondary school ensures that they start Year 7 full of excitement and with minimal nervousness. This section contains important and up-to-date information about our transition programme. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Ms Young (Deputy Head – Student Opportunity) or Mr Matthews (Head of Year 7). Transitioning Into Secondary We strive to do our utmost to ensure that the transition from Year 6 to Year 7 is as smooth and welcoming as possible. Days for Your Diary Upcoming activities: Secondary pastoral leaders visit Year 6 children in their classrooms to hold informal Q&A sessions. Parent Coffee Mornings are held in Term Two and Three to learn more about the Secondary School and how to support your children with the transition process. This is an opportunity to meet key members of staff such as the Secondary Leadership Team. During the summer term, children will have the opportunity to experience Secondary Taster lessons. This will give them the chance to meet some of our secondary school staff and experience this part of the school building. More information and timings for the above events will be available soon via VLE. Approach To Learning In Secondary Our approach encourages students to build the skills and learning habits to become independent thinkers – preparing them for life way beyond Year 13. Thinking Skills At Sunmarke through our ‘Positive Education’ inclusive approach, students are enabled to flourish in a safe, happy and nurturing learning environment. They are stretched and challenged to ask and develop their own questions to harness their potential to the maximum. Opportunities are provided through numerous activities undertaken in the classroom, on the sports field, on stage, through educational visits abroad, organising charity events, or representing the school as outstanding ambassadors. Leadership There are numerous opportunities for leadership from informal roles within the classroom to formal roles outside of the classroom e.g. Prefects, School and Community Ambassadors. Students can aspire to leadership roles within and outside their year groups. These roles are designed to promote excellence while enabling student leaders to play a role in the development of the school and community. The Student Hub within the Secondary School is a dedicated space for secondary students to meet with their Student Leadership Team. At Sunmarke we believe in student voice and the sharing of ideas. The Hub provides a platform for every student to be heard and to interact with their Student Leaders. Digital Learning Sunmarke students are adept at using technology through class assignment and quizzes, home learning, submission and assessments, online collaboration and communication between students and teachers, tracking progress and behaviour and access to school resources, library books and information. We promote and sustain a culture that encourages the integration of digital technologies into all areas of the curriculum. Students engage and collaborate with their peers using a variety of digital environments and tools. Cyber-safety is an integral part of how the school community works with everyone being aware of their digital responsibilities, modelling ethical and appropriate use of digital resources. Please view our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) here . Social Responsibility Our principled, creative and innovative learning environment encourages students to have a responsibility ‘for’ and ‘towards’ the community. They learn to be solution-focused, discuss controversial topics, share their opinions on what they learn, ask questions and engage in dialogue. Environment and Sustainability Sustainability is a key agenda at Sunmarke School. We believe that we have a shared responsibility as citizens of the world to choose sustainable practices and we empower our students to do the same.

Economics – Our Business and Economics courses cover topics such as economic growth vs development, effects of trade and globalisation, the impact of deforestation etc. Students are encouraged to research policies to solve urgent environmental issues. The Sciences – A Level and IB Biology – Both courses include the study of ecosystems, ecology and biodiversity. Secondary students also look into the sustainability of using earth’s resources and assess the impact of extracting, using and recycling. Global Outlook Our excellent, holistic education and team of dedicated teachers place values like honesty, responsibility, tolerance and respect for the rights of others irrespective of nationality, gender, culture or religion at the foundation of learning. This provides students the skills and knowledge to meet the challenges of the future.

As an inclusive school, Sunmarke offers a wide range of options at Key Stage 4. Through offering GCSE, IGCSE, and BTEC courses, we are able to accommodate a wide range of learning styles, whilst ensuring the level of challenge is such that all post-16 pathways remain open to students. GCSE examinations are the mainstay of an English education, with most students following this pathway. At Sunmarke we also offer IGCSE examinations; the ‘I’ stands for international and means the course has been adapted to suit a more international student body. The difficulty level of GCSE and IGCSE exams are the same, but the content of GCSE examinations is more English-centred. A good example of this would be in Business Studies where the case studies for a GCSE would be UK companies, which many of our students would not have heard of. This is why we follow the IGCSE pathway for Business Studies, meaning the case studies focus on large multi-national companies all our students would know. BTEC courses are as challenging as GCSE course but are assessed in a different manner. All BTEC courses are coursework based, with students undertaking assessed units every 12 weeks or so, these are all graded, and the outcome is the sum of these assessments. BTEC courses suit students who prefer to ‘chunk’ their assessments rather than taking one or two summative exams at the end of the course which determine their final outcome. Compulsory subjects and options choices All students study the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, Arabic, Games and Moral, Social Cultural Studies. In addition to these core subjects, students also select four additional subjects from our extensive list of optional subjects.

As an inclusive school, Sunmarke offers a wide range of options at Key Stage 4. Through offering GCSE, IGCSE, and BTEC courses, we are able to accommodate a wide range of learning styles, whilst ensuring the level of challenge is such that all post-16 pathways remain open to students. GCSE examinations are the mainstay of an English education, with most students following this pathway. At Sunmarke we also offer IGCSE examinations; the ‘I’ stands for international and means the course has been adapted to suit a more international student body. The difficulty level of GCSE and IGCSE exams are the same, but the content of GCSE examinations is more English-centred. A good example of this would be in Business Studies where the case studies for a GCSE would be UK companies, which many of our students would not have heard of. This is why we follow the IGCSE pathway for Business Studies, meaning the case studies focus on large multi-national companies all our students would know. BTEC courses are as challenging as GCSE course but are assessed in a different manner. All BTEC courses are coursework based, with students undertaking assessed units every 12 weeks or so, these are all graded, and the outcome is the sum of these assessments. BTEC courses suit students who prefer to ‘chunk’ their assessments rather than taking one or two summative exams at the end of the course which determine their final outcome. Compulsory subjects and options choices All students study the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, Arabic, Games and Moral, Social Cultural Studies. In addition to these core subjects, students also select four additional subjects from our extensive list of optional subjects. Each of these subjects is listed below with a brief outline of the course content and the method of assessment.

Through our different pathways, we encourage students to ask questions about the world around them and think from multiple perspectives. We are unique in offering A-Levels, BTECs, and being an IB World School, we also offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Whether students choose the A-Level, BTEC; or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme pathway, we inspire purpose and drive passion. Here at Sunmarke we care about the journey that students go on and the skills they develop along the way. Our students are not defined by grades, they are a collection of skills and interests that show their passion, and we want them to strive to be better learners to best prepare them for the path they choose after they graduate. Students will develop these skills through sessions run in form time on developing as a learner and preparing for higher education. While attending sessions for the latter, students will be exposed to resources that will help them explore their passions through reading, videos and courses outside of the curriculum that are now available online at the click of a button. Outside of the form room is where you will differ in terms of skills developed. The International Baccalaureate Programmes places more of an emphasis in developing a variety of skills due to the diverse subjects students have to take whereas A-Levels allow students to delve deeper into a smaller selection of subjects. Different still are BTEC qualifications which have no exams and will, therefore, develop your investigation and research skills as you look to answer your briefs. Leadership All students at Sunmarke’s Sixth Form are leaders and role models and they embrace this responsibility fully. These young leaders play a crucial role in the growth of the school and the community. Within their academics, students are provided options to lead their own learning such as through the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), available to A Level and BTEC students or through various pieces of coursework, such as the Extended Essay and Reflective Project on the International Baccalaureate pathways. There are several opportunities for students to assume leadership roles, form their own extra-curricular activities and represent the school as Senior Prefects, Senior Student Leadership Team, House Captains and Subject Ambassadors. Thinking Skills Preparing students to flourish in an environment that encourages critical and independent thinking, Sunmarke’s Sixth Form is imbued with the Positive Education approach. Students are trained through the Theory of Knowledge (TOK) curriculum that motivates them to ask questions about the world around them and think from multiple perspectives. Digital Learning Sixth Form students model the use and integration of digital technologies throughout their curriculum. Many digital tools are available such as Questia School, an online library and UniFrog, a platform for search, shortlist and applying for university courses. Sixth Form Students are taught to be at ease with technology, but also encouraged to question its validity, reliability and responsibility in a modern world. Media literacy is given a lot of importance at Sunmarke as students prepare to navigate the world beyond the school. Please view our Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy here . Social Responsibility Sunmarke Sixth Formers take the lead in service, learning and providing solutions while developing collaboration, leadership and social skills. There are structured programmes for students to follow such as CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) and Service Learning that lists a set of objectives to be used as guidance. These are ‘need and solution-based’ programmes where students can choose to give service to their peers, the school, the local community and even make a global difference. These programmes make them understand the difference they can make to the world while developing emotional intelligence. Global Outlook As an international school training students to excel globally, we foster an ethos of honesty, responsibility, tolerance and respect for others within the academic and Positive Education curriculum. Sixth Form students take a leading role in celebrations such as International Day by sharing their own cultures and traditions with the rest of the community. As a multi-pathway school, we aim to make our students global citizens. Key Stage 4 Options Booklet Sunmarke has designed the below listed booklet to give information to our students about the courses they could study in Years 10 and 11.

Advanced Level qualifications (known as A-Levels) are individual subject based qualifications. They are one option available to students who are looking to study at university. With A-Levels being standalone qualifications, there is no requirement on subject combinations and students’ only constraint is the combinations available within the school timetable. A-Levels are graded from A*-E. What does this Pathway look like? Students will usually take 3 or 4 A-Levels and this would be what universities would be looking for as offers are based mainly on 3 A-Level grades. If you are debating which subjects to choose, we recommend you start with 4 A-Levels so you can have a range to begin with which you can narrow down later. Students will receive 6 lessons per subject each week with most subjects being 100% examination-based. Subjects either fit into the category of modular A-Levels or linear A-Levels. In modular subjects, students will take up to three exams in Year 12 and up to three in Year 13 whereas, with linear A-Levels, students complete all exams at the end of Year 13. How does this Pathway lead to University? A-Levels are internationally recognised qualifications which will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. While taking A-Levels would give you the necessary prerequisites with regards to subjects, you may need to take further tests in English in order to study at universities where courses are delivered in English. In addition, students wishing to study certain subjects worldwide need to review the Mathematics requirements for entry into the university of their choice. What skills will I develop? Taking a combination of A-Levels will allow you to specialise in a particular area post 16 as opposed to waiting until you begin university. With few subjects having coursework components, there is a lot of focus on exam skills. However, there is the option of taking the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in order to develop your academic writing and research skills. Furthermore, the EPQ is a perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate and develop your interest in an area you want to go on to study at university; competitive universities are always looking for examples of students pursuing their academic passions outside of the classroom. Whether it be the other EPQ or another opportunity, we recommend you find an outlet to explore your passions through extra-curricular activities."

Short for Business and Technology Education Council, BTECs are a practical-based, vocational qualification which offers the same equivalence to A-Levels when converted into UCAS points. Many industry sectors have a set of National Occupational Standards that professionals must follow. The learning content of BTECs is built around these National Occupational Standards, which is why BTECs are recognised as valuable qualifications. They provide the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a field or subject and are an excellent alternative to the more theory focused A-Levels or subjects on the IB Diploma Programme. What does this Pathway look like? BTECs are taught through application with students often going on educational visits and meeting industry specialists as well as completing one week of work experience in Year 12. Assessments are via regular coursework and projects throughout the 2-year course. If you know you don’t excel in exam conditions, BTECs can relieve this pressure, spreading out the work that dictates your final grade as 100% of your final grade will come from these coursework components. Students are able to take a combination of BTECs and A-Levels in order to have a balance between hands on learning whilst also taking more traditional subjects. How does this Pathway lead to University? BTECs are equivalent to A-Levels in terms of applications to universities. However, there are some universities which don’t accept these qualifications so you would need to research the different countries you would like to apply for in order to ensure you meet the admissions criteria for your desired destination. What skills will I develop? BTECs truly prepare students for the real world, offering them practical skills to be successful in the industry of their choosing. If you enjoy practical learning and want to study a specialised range of subjects, BTECs are the perfect option for you. Within each subject, more technical skills are developed; for example, we are very proud of our BTEC Media courses that allow students to create using hi-tech equipment as students learn how to get the most out of this technology."

Find out more about the details of the IB Diploma Programme at Sunmarke. What is the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme? The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is a holistic programme which gives you a broad post 16 education whilst also allowing you to specialise in three subjects. You will take three Standard Level subjects and three Higher Level subjects as well as the Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge and the Creativity, Activity and Service Programme (CAS). Each subject is graded from 1-7 with the diploma core (Theory of Knowledge and Extended Essay) giving 3 more points depending on the combination of grades in these components. Students must achieve a minimum total of 24 points to pass the Diploma Programme. What does this Pathway look like? Each week you will receive lessons in your 6 subjects (typically 4 lessons for higher level and 3 for standard level) as well as lessons in Theory of Knowledge (TOK). You will also receive sessions to develop writing and research skills needed for the Extended Essay. This is a piece of academic writing where you choose the subject, topic and research question to produce an answer in a 4,000 word research report. The CAS programme is a non-graded component which encourages students to set objectives in creative, active and service experiences outside of the classroom. Each subject has a coursework component worth at least 20% meaning the whole grade does not rest on the final exams. How does this Pathway lead to University? An internationally recognised qualification, the IBDP will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. With the DP developing more than just subject knowledge, universities see it as a perfect higher education preparation programme. As all students study English Language and Literature, you will meet the language requirement of most universities that deliver courses in English. The IBDP programme also continues a student’s study in Mathematics. Students completing the IBDP programme continue to study Mathematics and English throughout their Secondary education and are then able to demonstrate 4 years of study in Mathematics and English during the application process. The IB Diploma, due to its holistic nature and its requirements, is highly valued by universities worldwide. What skills will I develop? Through coursework components, the Extended Essay and Theory of Knowledge, you will learn to think critically, write well constructed, balanced arguments and write using an academic structure. The CAS programme develops skills to ensure you are a well-rounded student who has lots of experiences beyond the classroom to make you really stand out in university applications and interviews.

Throughout the two years of the programme, teachers will promote these attributes in lessons to help students become better learners which will enhance their academic journey and prepare them to be more independent after graduating from school. Below are the 10 traits that make up the IB Learner Profile."

Students works closely with these experts and parents are always welcome to speak to our Careers and University team to find a pathway suitable for their child. Through conversations and research, students can find their calling and a pathway of study that excites and enthuses. Read below to see the different opportunities and platforms we use in order to help students get excited about education outside of the Sunmarke classrooms. UNIFROG Unifrog is the career and university platform that is used at Sunmarke School. It’s an impartial, user-friendly platform that helps students to research their future pathways. It contains a repository of career lessons, information on pathways, universities around the world, CV builder, personality tests, and links to MOOCs (online courses). Unifrog is useful for students in their last four years of study but can be accessed and used by all in Secondary. Students can use the platform to start to explore the different post 18 pathways and the application process for their chosen route. Careers lessons in Y12 focus on psychometric testing, university and career research and to start working on application requirements such as personal statements and US university essays. We encourage all families to explore this platform together as early as possible in order to start the conversation as to where a student may study as well as what the course requirements are in order to make sure the right combination of subjects are being chosen post 16. There are many factors that go into shortlisting universities such as location, size, tuition fees or university housing to name just a few; with all this choice, it is important to narrow down to specific countries in Year 12 so the application process is not overwhelming in Year 13. Students work one-on-one with the university careers counsellors who assist and guide students through every step of the application process. University Destinations Sunmarke students achieve their first choice university destinations which has included UK Russel Group schools, and top Worldwide destinations such as the Imperial College London, NYU, University of Amsterdam, Bocconi, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, UC San Diego, Georgia Tech, The University of Toronto, McGill and University of Edinburgh.

Children enroling into FS2, starting in September, must be four years old on or before the 31st of August. Similarly, children enroling into Year 1, starting school in September, must be five years old on or before the 31st of August. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. This includes students who enrol for the final term of the 2023/24 academic year. Schools that start the academic year in September, in line with MOE Resolution no (24). Year Group Age requirement Foundation Stage 1 3 years old by August 31st Foundation Stage 2 4 years old by August 31st Year 1 5 years old by August 31 Year 2 6 years old by August 31 2. When did this change come into effect? This change was applicable from the start of the 2021/22 academic year in September 2021. 3. Why was this change made? This decision was made to bring more consistency to the cut-off dates used by schools in the UAE with those used by schools abroad. For example, UK schools in the UAE will now have the same cut-off date as schools in the UK, and international British schools. 4.Who will this change impact? This change will impact children up to six years old who are enrolling in school for the first time. 5. Will the new cut-off date apply to all year groups? It will apply to new students enrolling in FS1, FS2, Year 1 and Year 2 in all schools in the UAE, as stipulated in the MOE resolution. 6. My child was born in October and is now in FS1 – I want to enrol him in another school for FS2. Can I do this or does he have to repeat a year? Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year – before the changes come into effect – will she be able to start Year 1 next year? Yes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. 9. I’ve already registered and paid the deposit for my daughter to start school in FS2 in September. She will be four years old in November. Is she affected by this? According to the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution, your daughter will not be able to start in FS2 in September. Alternatively, we would be happy to transfer your child’s application to their age-appropriate year group (FS1) and register your child for this year group instead. Parents whose children are affected by the new cut-off dates and who have already paid deposits for their children’s enrolment are entitled to a refund if they wish. 10.

Click here to read Guidelines for Admissions and Transfers by KHDA. What are the age requirements for AY 2024-25? 1. What are the changes to the age requirements for entry to Sunmarke School? Age requirements will change for new students enroled into FS1, according to the UAE Ministry of Education Resolution no (24). Children enroling into FS1, starting in September, must be three years old on or before the 31st of August. Children enroling into FS2, starting in September, must be four years old on or before the 31st of August. Similarly, children enroling into Year 1, starting school in September, must be five years old on or before the 31st of August. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. This includes students who enrol for the final term of the 2023/24 academic year. Schools that start the academic year in September, in line with MOE Resolution no (24). Year Group Age requirement Foundation Stage 1 3 years old by August 31st Foundation Stage 2 4 years old by August 31st Year 1 5 years old by August 31 Year 2 6 years old by August 31 2. When did this change come into effect? This change was applicable from the start of the 2021/22 academic year in September 2021. 3. Why was this change made? This decision was made to bring more consistency to the cut-off dates used by schools in the UAE with those used by schools abroad. For example, UK schools in the UAE will now have the same cut-off date as schools in the UK, and international British schools. 4.Who will this change impact? This change will impact children up to six years old who are enrolling in school for the first time. 5. Will the new cut-off date apply to all year groups? It will apply to new students enrolling in FS1, FS2, Year 1 and Year 2 in all schools in the UAE, as stipulated in the MOE resolution. 6. My child was born in October and is now in FS1 – I want to enrol him in another school for FS2. Can I do this or does he have to repeat a year? Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year – before the changes come into effect – will she be able to start Year 1 next year? Yes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. 9. I’ve already registered and paid the deposit for my daughter to start school in FS2 in September. She will be four years old in November. Is she affected by this? According to the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution, your daughter will not be able to start in FS2 in September. Alternatively, we would be happy to transfer your child’s application to their age-appropriate year group (FS1) and register your child for this year group instead. Parents whose children are affected by the new cut-off dates and who have already paid deposits for their children’s enrolment are entitled to a refund if they wish. 10.

Our Achievement Centre offers a broad range of additional support for students with SEND, including targeted support in language, maths, literacy, and functional independence. We are currently working to develop our range of alternative curriculum pathways for Key Stages 2, 3, and 4 so that, in time, we can offer an appropriate pathway for every learner. What is Year 7 and Year 8 Life skills Pathway? 1. Is it approved by the Ministry of Education? It is a mainstream curriculum, supplemented by ASDAN modules. As it is a supplemented curriculum which focuses on reduced teachers, as per KHDA, there is no need for permission for this pathway as it falls under our current education licence. 2. What are the timings if my son is enroled in this program? The timings are that of the normal school day, unless the student has additional needs or commitments outside of school that need to be met. As a KHDA accredited Rahhal provider, we can review timings to meet the student’s needs. 3. What is the cost for LSA? Costs are an estimate range until all students are enroled. 4. What would be mentioned in the invoice for this program? Is it “Tuition fee”? School fees are billed as normal. Parents will then have to sign a KHDA Individual Service Agreement for the LSA cost. This will then be a separate invoice. 5 How will I enrol my child? Our SENCO will assess the student before we can accept to ensure we can meet their needs in this class. It is a pathway that supports access to the mainstream and we can’t cater for severe needs.

For example, UK schools in the UAE will now have the same cut-off date as schools in the UK, and international British schools. 4.Who will this change impact? This change will impact children up to six years old who are enrolling in school for the first time. 5. Will the new cut-off date apply to all year groups? It will apply to new students enrolling in FS1, FS2, Year 1 and Year 2 in all schools in the UAE, as stipulated in the MOE resolution. 6. My child was born in October and is now in FS1 – I want to enrol him in another school for FS2. Can I do this or does he have to repeat a year? Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year – before the changes come into effect – will she be able to start Year 1 next year? Yes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. 9. I’ve already registered and paid the deposit for my daughter to start school in FS2 in September. She will be four years old in November. Is she affected by this? According to the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution, your daughter will not be able to start in FS2 in September. Alternatively, we would be happy to transfer your child’s application to their age-appropriate year group (FS1) and register your child for this year group instead. Parents whose children are affected by the new cut-off dates and who have already paid deposits for their children’s enrolment are entitled to a refund if they wish. 10. My child was born one day after the cut-off date. Is there some leeway given? No exceptions to the cut-off dates will be given under any circumstances How do I book Assessments for entry 2025-26 AY? Admissions are now open for applications for 2025-26 AY* entry. The 2025-2026 Assessment Diary is Open – We are now booking assessments for year groups FS1 & FS2, Year 1 to 10 and Year 12.

Tariff for the following KHDA services as stipulated by KHDA: Request for student Education Continuation Certificate for visa renewal (AED 120) Request for student leaving form for the students who are leaving Dubai (AED 120) Request for student transfer between private schools (within the stipulated time frame)-Student transfer (AED 120) Can my child with special education needs attend Sunmarke school? At Sunmarke, we exercise a positive and inclusive admissions policy. Candidates will each be given due consideration on a case-by-case basis, and we will take into account the capacity of the premises, staff and curriculum pathways to effectively meet the needs of the individual. Our Achievement Centre offers a broad range of additional support for students with SEND, including targeted support in language, maths, literacy, and functional independence. We are currently working to develop our range of alternative curriculum pathways for Key Stages 2, 3, and 4 so that, in time, we can offer an appropriate pathway for every learner. What is Year 7 and Year 8 Life skills Pathway? 1. Is it approved by the Ministry of Education? It is a mainstream curriculum, supplemented by ASDAN modules. As it is a supplemented curriculum which focuses on reduced teachers, as per KHDA, there is no need for permission for this pathway as it falls under our current education licence. 2. What are the timings if my son is enroled in this program? The timings are that of the normal school day, unless the student has additional needs or commitments outside of school that need to be met. As a KHDA accredited Rahhal provider, we can review timings to meet the student’s needs. 3. What is the cost for LSA? Costs are an estimate range until all students are enroled. 4. What would be mentioned in the invoice for this program? Is it “Tuition fee”? School fees are billed as normal. Parents will then have to sign a KHDA Individual Service Agreement for the LSA cost. This will then be a separate invoice. 5 How will I enrol my child? Our SENCO will assess the student before we can accept to ensure we can meet their needs in this class. It is a pathway that supports access to the mainstream and we can’t cater for severe needs.

During these formative years, children explore the world around them, develop their imagination, and begin to express their thoughts and emotions in unique ways. Integrating art and creative activities into the EYFS curriculum plays a pivotal role in this developmental journey. Art is more than just drawing or painting—it is a powerful tool that allows children to communicate ideas that they may not yet have the words to express. In EYFS, children are encouraged to experiment with colors, textures, and materials, giving them the freedom to explore and create. This process not only develops fine motor skills but also boosts confidence as children see their ideas come to life. Creativity in early years education is closely linked to cognitive and emotional development. When children engage in art, they learn to make decisions, solve problems, and think critically. For instance, choosing which colors to mix, how to build a structure with blocks, or deciding what story to tell through a drawing all stimulate their brain in meaningful ways. Furthermore, creative activities offer a safe space for children to express emotions, explore feelings, and develop empathy. A child who paints a stormy sky might be working through feelings of frustration or excitement—art becomes a mirror to their inner world. At Sunmarke, our EYFS classrooms are designed to inspire creativity. We provide a rich variety of resources—from paints, clay, and fabrics to natural materials like leaves and shells. Teachers act as facilitators rather than directors, guiding children gently while allowing them the autonomy to explore. This approach encourages independent thinking and celebrates individual expression. Music, drama, and storytelling also play a vital role in nurturing creativity. Singing songs, role-playing, and creating stories enable children to develop language skills, imagination, and social interaction. Collaborative art projects, for example, foster teamwork and communication, helping children learn to share ideas and respect different perspectives. Parents are key partners in this journey. Encouraging children to explore creativity at home, whether through doodling, crafting, or imaginative play, reinforces what they experience at school. At Sunmarke, we actively involve families in celebrating children’s artwork and creative achievements, recognizing that encouragement and appreciation fuel confidence and motivation. Ultimately, fostering art and creativity in EYFS is about more than producing beautiful artwork. It is about empowering children to explore, express, and understand themselves and the world around them. By providing the right environment, resources, and guidance, Sunmarke ensures that every child’s unique voice is heard, celebrated, and nurtured from the very beginning of their educational journey. 0 Shares Prev Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

As industries transform, new careers emerge, and global competition rises, students need more than subject knowledge, they need the mindset, skills, and adaptability to thrive in a rapidly changing environment. This is where Career Readiness becomes essential. What Is Career Readiness? Career Readiness refers to the knowledge, skills, behaviours, and experiences students need to succeed in the workplace. It encompasses much more than choosing a career pathway, it’s about developing essential competencies that empower young people to make informed decisions, adapt to challenges, and pursue meaningful, successful careers. At its core, Career Readiness includes: Critical thinking and problem-solving Communication and collaboration Leadership and initiative Digital literacy and innovation Professionalism, work ethic, and adaptability Self-awareness and goal-setting Real-world exposure and experience When these skills are nurtured, students feel confident navigating their academic journeys and future career choices. Why Does Career Readiness Matter Today? A Rapidly Changing Job Market The careers students will step into tomorrow may not even exist today. Automation, AI, and technological advancements are reshaping industries at record speed. Career Readiness equips students to adapt, learn continuously, and remain competitive in this dynamic landscape. Bridging the Skills Gap Employers increasingly look for candidates who bring more than qualifications, they seek individuals with strong soft skills, creativity, emotional intelligence, and the ability to collaborate and think critically. Career Readiness programmes bridge this gap by equipping students with these highly sought-after competencies. Helping Students Make Informed Decisions With hundreds of pathways available, from university and vocational programmes to entrepreneurship, students can easily feel overwhelmed. Career Readiness provides clarity through career exploration, mentorship, and guidance, helping students understand their strengths and passions so they can choose the right path confidently. Building Confidence and Independence Through internships, workshops, leadership opportunities, and real-world projects, students gain hands-on experience that builds independence, resilience, and self-belief, qualities that stay with them for life. Fostering Future-Ready Leaders In an increasingly interconnected world, students must be global citizens who think beyond borders. Career Readiness nurtures leadership, empathy, communication, and cross-cultural understanding, skills essential for success in both further studies and the workplace. Career Readiness at Sunmarke At Sunmarke School, Career Readiness is woven into the fabric of our educational philosophy. Through our Careers Development Programme , students receive personalised guidance, access to industry experts, mentorship opportunities, university counselling, and immersive experiences that prepare them for future success. Whether through workshops, internships, Signature Programmes, or global exposure, we equip our students with everything they need to pursue their aspirations with confidence and clarity. Career Readiness is no longer optional, it is vital. By empowering students with the right skills, guidance, and experiences, we ensure they are not only prepared for the future but ready to shape it. At Sunmarke, we remain committed to developing future-ready learners who excel academically, grow personally, and lead with purpose in an ever-changing world. 0 Shares Prev Recent Blogs 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

As industries transform, new careers emerge, and global competition rises, students need more than subject knowledge, they need the mindset, skills, and adaptability to thrive in a rapidly changing environment. This is where Career Readiness becomes essential. What Is Career Readiness? Career Readiness refers to the knowledge, skills, behaviours, and experiences students need to succeed in the workplace. It encompasses much more than choosing a career pathway, it’s about developing essential competencies that empower young people to make informed decisions, adapt to challenges, and pursue meaningful, successful careers. At its core, Career Readiness includes: Critical thinking and problem-solving Communication and collaboration Leadership and initiative Digital literacy and innovation Professionalism, work ethic, and adaptability Self-awareness and goal-setting Real-world exposure and experience When these skills are nurtured, students feel confident navigating their academic journeys and future career choices. Why Does Career Readiness Matter Today? A Rapidly Changing Job Market The careers students will step into tomorrow may not even exist today. Automation, AI, and technological advancements are reshaping industries at record speed. Career Readiness equips students to adapt, learn continuously, and remain competitive in this dynamic landscape. Bridging the Skills Gap Employers increasingly look for candidates who bring more than qualifications, they seek individuals with strong soft skills, creativity, emotional intelligence, and the ability to collaborate and think critically. Career Readiness programmes bridge this gap by equipping students with these highly sought-after competencies. Helping Students Make Informed Decisions With hundreds of pathways available, from university and vocational programmes to entrepreneurship, students can easily feel overwhelmed. Career Readiness provides clarity through career exploration, mentorship, and guidance, helping students understand their strengths and passions so they can choose the right path confidently. Building Confidence and Independence Through internships, workshops, leadership opportunities, and real-world projects, students gain hands-on experience that builds independence, resilience, and self-belief, qualities that stay with them for life. Fostering Future-Ready Leaders In an increasingly interconnected world, students must be global citizens who think beyond borders. Career Readiness nurtures leadership, empathy, communication, and cross-cultural understanding, skills essential for success in both further studies and the workplace.

As centres of learning and community, they can model the values and habits needed to care for our planet. At Sunmarke School, sustainability is not a stand-alone project; it’s embedded in our culture and daily life. Through our Environment and Sustainability Signature Programme, students across all year groups engage in practical, hands-on initiatives that promote environmental awareness, responsibility, and leadership. Education Beyond the Classroom At Sunmarke, sustainability is learned by doing. Students don’t just study environmental issues in the classroom; they take meaningful action to make a difference. Our Eco Warriors and Eco Committee play a central role in leading sustainability initiatives across the school. These include recycling through Recapp, ensuring plastic, cans, and paper are properly collected and reused, and the Hydroponics Project, which teaches students about sustainable food production. Sunlight Fridays encourage energy conservation by asking everyone to switch off classroom lights, while the Book Swap and newly launched Uniform Swap promote a culture of reuse, helping students exchange items that no longer fit or are no longer needed. Our Forest School sessions give younger learners the opportunity to connect directly with nature through outdoor exploration and environmental learning. These experiences help them develop respect for natural habitats, understand biodiversity, and see first-hand the importance of caring for living things. Through these initiatives, students gain a practical understanding of how small, consistent actions can contribute to a more sustainable world. Creating Greener Spaces and Sustainable Habits Sustainability at Sunmarke extends beyond individual projects to the way the school itself operates. Classrooms and corridors have dedicated recycling systems, which students monitor and maintain as part of their leadership roles. Green corners, composting projects, and the use of repurposed materials in Design Technology lessons show how sustainable thinking can be integrated into daily learning. In collaboration with our catering partners, Mastercook, students have also explored ways to make school dining more sustainable, from reducing food waste to improving recycling practices within the canteen. These efforts demonstrate that environmental responsibility can be built into every aspect of school life, encouraging students to think critically about the impact of their choices. Building a Community of Changemakers Sustainability thrives when it is supported by an engaged community. At Sunmarke, students, staff, and partners work together to create lasting impact. Our students represent the school in the Alliance for Sustainable Schools, take part in national and regional eco initiatives, and lead projects such as the BIC Pen Recycling Challenge, the Design a Reusable Cup Competition, and the Upcycle Challenge. Through these experiences, they learn that protecting the environment is not just an individual responsibility but a shared commitment. This collaborative approach strengthens our school’s community and shows that collective action is essential for meaningful change. Preparing Students for a Sustainable Future By making sustainability part of everyday school life, Sunmarke is preparing students to lead with purpose and innovation. Whether they are growing herbs in hydroponic stations, designing with recycled materials, or presenting environmental ideas to school leadership, students are developing the confidence, creativity, and compassion needed to shape a sustainable future. The Environment and Sustainability Signature Programme ensures that they leave Sunmarke not only with academic excellence but also with the mindset and values to become responsible global citizens. At Sunmarke, sustainability is more than a lesson; it’s a mindset. Together, our students are learning that small actions, when multiplied across a community, can create meaningful change for the planet. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

From automated journalism to AI-generated visuals and music, technology is reshaping the way content is created, shared, and consumed. For young creators today, this digital revolution opens up unprecedented opportunities to experiment, innovate, and make their voices heard. AI tools now allow creators to produce high-quality content with speed and precision. For instance, AI-powered video editing software can analyse hours of footage and suggest the best cuts, while AI music generators can compose original tracks in minutes. This not only reduces the technical barriers to entry but also encourages experimentation, allowing young creators to focus more on storytelling and creative expression. At Sunmarke, our Media Studies programme equips students with the skills to navigate these emerging tools, combining traditional media techniques with digital innovation. Students explore everything from video production and journalism to content strategy and social media management, preparing them to thrive in a rapidly evolving landscape. One of the most exciting aspects of AI in media is its potential to democratise content creation. In the past, producing high-quality films, podcasts, or digital campaigns often required significant resources and expertise. Today, AI tools can level the playing field, enabling students and young creators to produce professional-grade work with minimal cost. Sunmarke’s Media Studies curriculum emphasises hands-on projects where students can experiment with AI-assisted storytelling, from producing short films to creating multimedia campaigns for school events. This practical approach fosters creativity while teaching students how to leverage technology responsibly. Moreover, AI is changing the way audiences engage with content. Algorithms analyse user behaviour, suggesting personalised videos, articles, and music, which challenges creators to understand and adapt to audience preferences. Sunmarke’s Media Studies programme encourages students to study these trends critically, integrating lessons on media ethics, audience analysis, and digital literacy. By understanding both the creative and analytical sides of media, students can craft content that resonates while remaining mindful of the societal impact of AI-driven platforms. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

Through our Entrepreneurship and Enterprise curriculum , students are not only inspired to dream big but are equipped with the mindset, skills, and confidence to turn those dreams into reality. Nurturing the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs Our approach to enterprise education begins early. From primary years, students are introduced to the basics of creativity, innovation, and problem-solving through engaging, hands-on projects. As they move into secondary school and sixth form, these foundational experiences evolve into structured entrepreneurial challenges, student-led businesses, and enterprise showcases that mirror real-world business environments. Learning Through Real Experience Enterprise at Sunmarke is more than a subject; it’s an experience. Students take ownership of projects that align with their personal interests — whether it’s fashion, technology, sustainability, or social innovation. From ideation to pitching to a panel of industry mentors, they go through every stage of launching a venture. For example, students have developed eco-friendly product lines, organized fundraising events for global causes, and even created digital startups with real customers. These initiatives are supported by our dedicated mentors and industry partnerships, allowing students to experience the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship firsthand. Innovation Through Signature Programmes Enterprise education is seamlessly woven across our Signature Programmes , including STEAM & Design Thinking , Positive Education , and the Sunmarke Mini MBA . Students are encouraged to apply the principles of design thinking — empathizing, ideating, prototyping, and testing — to bring meaningful solutions to community and global issues. Our Positive Education Ethos ensures that students develop the emotional intelligence and growth mindset necessary to navigate uncertainty and lead with purpose. Pathways to Professional Success The skills developed through these enterprise projects extend far beyond school. Sunmarke graduates enter university and professional life with an entrepreneurial edge — equipped with communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills that employers and global institutions value. Whether they choose to become startup founders, social entrepreneurs, or leaders within established organisations, our students leave Sunmarke with the confidence and experience to make an impact — not just in their careers, but in the world around them. Empowering Passion, Inspiring Purpose At Sunmarke, we celebrate every student’s journey — from their first creative idea to their first successful project. Our goal is simple: to nurture changemakers who can transform their passions into professions and shape a brighter, more innovative future. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

From online research and digital classrooms to social media and gaming, screens have become an essential part of a teenager’s day. While technology has opened up incredible learning opportunities, it’s equally important to nurture healthy digital habits that promote balance, well-being, and academic success. At Sunmarke School, well-being is not just a subject, it’s a way of life. Through our Positive Education Ethos , we focus on developing students’ character strengths, emotional intelligence, and mindfulness to help them thrive in a digitally connected world. Understanding Digital Balance Sunmarke’s teaching approach integrates technology meaningfully into the curriculum. Students engage in blended learning environments using tools such as iPads, Google Classroom, and interactive digital platforms to enhance collaboration and creativity. However, we also teach the importance of moderation. Through our Well-being and Life Skills lessons , students learn to manage screen time consciously, understanding when technology adds value to their learning and when it’s time to switch off. Teachers regularly encourage “tech breaks” during lessons, giving students moments to refocus, move around, or engage in hands-on, real-world learning activities. This ensures that digital engagement supports, rather than overwhelms, their overall growth. The Power of Restful Sleep Sleep plays a vital role in memory, focus, and emotional well-being, especially for teenagers juggling academics, extracurriculars, and social connections. Yet, increased screen exposure, particularly before bedtime, can disrupt healthy sleep patterns. Sunmarke’s Positive Education and Well-being Framework helps students understand the science behind sleep and its connection to performance. Through activities such as mindfulness sessions, guided reflections, and digital detox challenges, students learn practical strategies to create healthy nighttime routines, such as reducing screen use an hour before bed, reading, or journalling instead. By embedding these lessons across the curriculum and in our Positive Education sessions , we empower students to make conscious choices that enhance both academic outcomes and mental health. Finding Focus: Study with Intention With the abundance of online resources available, students today have endless access to knowledge. But without proper boundaries, these same tools can lead to distractions and reduced productivity. At Sunmarke, we guide students to use technology as a tool for deep learning rather than shallow multitasking. Our teachers integrate metacognitive strategies – helping students plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning. Students are also encouraged to explore offline learning moments through reading, creative projects, and our signature STEAM & Design Thinking and Forest School programmes, which provide immersive, hands-on experiences away from screens. Empowering Teens to Thrive Digitally Our goal at Sunmarke is to raise responsible digital citizens, teenagers who understand that technology should empower, not consume, their lives. Through a blend of Positive Education , and Parent Well-being workshops, we work closely with families to foster balanced habits at home and at school. Parents are guided on how to model healthy screen use, set boundaries, and create environments where digital wellness is prioritised. In Conclusion In the digital world, balance is key. By integrating well-being, mindfulness, and purposeful technology use into every aspect of learning, Sunmarke ensures that our students grow not only as capable digital learners but also as resilient, self-aware individuals. At Sunmarke, we believe that when students learn to balance screen time, sleep, and study, they don’t just succeed academically – they truly thrive in life. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Our Fortes English Language Programme has been carefully designed to equip students with the skills and confidence to not only communicate effectively in today’s global environment, but to also grow into confident academic contributors in our English medium school. A Curriculum Rooted in Excellence The Fortes English Language Programme is embedded within Sunmarke School’s forward-thinking curriculum. Drawing on the best practices from leading educational frameworks, it emphasises the development of reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills through topic based input to ensure students are engaged. Lessons are carefully structured to progress from foundational knowledge of basic communicative language to advanced proficiency in cognitive academic language, allowing students to build confidence step by step. Unlike traditional programmes that focus solely on exams, Fortes encourages students to use English in real-world contexts. Whether it’s engaging in classroom debates, delivering presentations, or collaborating on creative writing projects, students are constantly applying their language skills in practical situations. Building Confidence Through Active Learning Confidence is the hallmark of a strong communicator. At Sunmarke, the Fortes programme is designed to nurture this quality by creating a supportive, immersive environment. Small group activities and peer discussions within small language focused classes allow students to practice speaking and listening without fear of making mistakes. Our teachers are not only language experts but also mentors who inspire students to take ownership of their learning. By setting achievable goals and celebrating progress, they help students overcome hesitation and find their authentic voice. Integrating Technology and Innovation The Fortes programme also leverages technology to enhance learning. Interactive platforms, multimedia resources, and personalised digital exercises make lessons engaging and adaptable to each student’s learning style. This modern approach ensures that students are comfortable using English across digital and traditional mediums alike, preparing them for future academic and professional environments. Beyond the Classroom At Sunmarke, learning extends beyond the classroom. These experiences help students internalise the language in ways that textbooks alone cannot achieve. By combining rigorous academic instruction with practical application, the Fortes English Learning Language Programme transforms students into articulate, confident communicators ready to thrive in any setting.

At Sunmarke School, our Secondary programme within the British curriculum is designed to go beyond traditional methods, equipping students with the knowledge, skills, and values they need to thrive in university, careers, and life. A Rich and Rigorous British Curriculum Our Secondary students follow the highly respected British curriculum, which provides a strong academic foundation while encouraging independent thought and intellectual curiosity. From Key Stage 3 through to IGCSEs and A-Levels, pupils are challenged to achieve excellence across subjects, but learning is never limited to memorising facts. Instead, we place emphasis on enquiry, critical thinking, and real-world application. Every lesson begins with a ‘Big Question’ – a thought-provoking prompt that sparks curiosity, encourages communication, and sets the stage for inquiry-based learning. By regularly linking subjects together and embedding global and UAE contexts into lessons, students see the relevance of what they learn and make authentic connections to the world around them. Active, Student-Centred Learning We believe that students learn best when they are active participants in their education. Lessons are designed to be engaging, interactive, and personalised. Teachers use project-based learning, collaborative activities, debates, and experiments to make knowledge come alive. Activities are carefully differentiated to meet the needs of diverse learners, using flexible grouping strategies and modified tasks to support and challenge each student. This ensures that every learner can progress at their own pace, while also developing confidence to explore new ways of learning. Student choice and autonomy are encouraged, enabling pupils to take ownership of their learning while developing open-mindedness and resilience. Reflection is embedded in every stage, with students engaging in ‘React’ feedback —a written dialogue with teachers on assessed work—to reflect, set goals, and drive progress forward. Problem-solving, innovation, and enterprise are intrinsic parts of learning. Whether analysing a Shakespearean play through performance, applying mathematical concepts to real-life problems, or designing sustainable solutions in science and design projects, students develop mastery alongside creativity and adaptability. Harnessing Technology and Innovation In a digital age, technology plays a central role in our classrooms. At Sunmarke, we integrate state-of-the-art learning platforms, virtual reality experiences, and AI-powered tools to personalise education. These tools enable real-time monitoring of student progress, allowing teachers to adjust instruction to suit readiness, interest, and learning styles. Technology also supports metacognitive growth—helping students set goals, monitor their progress, and reflect on their thinking. This explicit focus on self-regulation ensures that students not only consume knowledge but also understand how they learn best. Building Skills for Life Beyond subject knowledge, our Secondary programme focuses on nurturing essential life skills such as communication, problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, and resilience. Students are encouraged to articulate their thought processes and reasoning, deepening their understanding while sharpening their ability to collaborate and persuade. Through opportunities like Model United Nations, TEDx events, enterprise challenges, and entrepreneurship initiatives, students learn to work strategically, innovate boldly, and articulate their ideas with confidence. These experiences prepare them to become adaptable and compassionate leaders in an interconnected world. A Holistic Education Ethos Sunmarke’s Positive Education ethos underpins everything we do. We balance academic achievement with wellbeing, character development, and values-based learning. From arts and sports to service projects and community initiatives, students are given opportunities to thrive beyond the classroom. Our ethos ensures a well-rounded education that fosters both excellence and empathy, shaping individuals who are not only successful but also grounded, compassionate, and future-ready. Preparing for the Future Our forward-thinking approach ensures students are well-prepared for life beyond school. Dedicated career guidance, personalised learning pathways, university preparation programmes, and exposure to industry leaders provide clarity about aspirations and next steps. By integrating rigorous academics, innovative pedagogy, cutting-edge technology, and a strong emphasis on wellbeing, Sunmarke students graduate with outstanding results, adaptability, and purpose—the qualities needed to thrive in an ever-changing world. At Sunmarke, Secondary education goes far beyond the textbook. By blending the rigour of the British curriculum with innovative teaching methods, personalised learning, metacognitive strategies, and a strong focus on wellbeing and character, we create an environment where students are inspired to think critically, act compassionately, and achieve boldly. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

We believe the most meaningful learning happens when students actively engage with real-world challenges, think critically, and apply their knowledge in practical ways. This is why STEAM education – Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics – is at the heart of our curriculum, blending creativity with problem-solving and academic rigour. One of the most impactful approaches we take in our STEAM provision is Design Thinking. This method allows students to creatively solve real-world problems with empathy, collaboration, and interdisciplinary skills that mirror how professionals innovate and make meaningful change. Why Projects Matter in STEAM Education In the British curriculum, a strong emphasis is placed on developing not just knowledge, but also critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. Projects bring these aims to life. Connecting theory to practice: A lesson on renewable energy becomes far more memorable when students design and build their own solar-powered car. Encouraging creativity: The ‘A’ in STEAM ensures that artistry and innovation are woven into problem-solving, whether through designing prototypes, coding interactive media, or using visual arts to present findings. Building resilience: Projects often involve trial and error, encouraging pupils to see mistakes as opportunities to refine and improve their ideas. Collaboration and leadership: Working in groups helps students practise teamwork, communication, and leadership – vital skills for university and future careers. Sunmarke’s Approach to STEAM Projects From Early Years through to Sixth Form , Sunmarke pupils take part in projects that are carefully designed to stretch their imagination while strengthening academic knowledge. In EYFS and Primary, children explore hands-on challenges such as building catapults, designing sustainable vehicles, constructing drone chassis, baking for Fairtrade and healthy eating while running a marketing enterprise, creating space rovers and rockets, and experimenting with zoetropes. In Secondary , students delve deeper into cross-disciplinary tasks. For example, they might design a sustainable home that integrates principles from science, technology, and design thinking, or create a digital animation that communicates a scientific concept to younger pupils. Students also shine on global platforms, such as Junk Kouture , where Sunmarke teams have achieved remarkable recognition by designing high-fashion outfits from recycled materials—blending sustainability, creativity, and engineering in a way that inspires peers around the world. At Sixth Form level, projects become even more sophisticated, aligning with GCSE, A-Level and BTEC coursework. Students often tackle real-world case studies, sometimes in partnership with external organisations or industry experts, preparing them for higher education and the workplace. Preparing Students for the Future Project-based STEAM learning aligns perfectly with the skills demanded by the 21st-century economy. Employers are increasingly seeking individuals who can innovate, adapt, and collaborate. By immersing pupils in real-life scenarios and encouraging them to think outside the box, Sunmarke equips students not only with academic excellence but also with the mindset to become future-ready leaders, creators, and problem-solvers. A Culture of Innovation At Sunmarke, projects aren’t an “add-on” but a core philosophy of learning. They showcase our commitment to Positive Education , where academic success is balanced with character development, wellbeing, and a spirit of innovation. By learning through doing, our students gain confidence in their abilities, pride in their achievements, and the courage to take on new challenges. In essence, Sunmarke’s STEAM projects bring learning to life. They transform abstract theories into tangible experiences, empower pupils to discover their passions, and prepare them to make meaningful contributions in an ever-changing world. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

In EYFS and Primary, children explore hands-on challenges such as building catapults, designing sustainable vehicles, constructing drone chassis, baking for Fairtrade and healthy eating while running a marketing enterprise, creating space rovers and rockets, and experimenting with zoetropes. In Secondary , students delve deeper into cross-disciplinary tasks. For example, they might design a sustainable home that integrates principles from science, technology, and design thinking, or create a digital animation that communicates a scientific concept to younger pupils. Students also shine on global platforms, such as Junk Kouture , where Sunmarke teams have achieved remarkable recognition by designing high-fashion outfits from recycled materials—blending sustainability, creativity, and engineering in a way that inspires peers around the world. At Sixth Form level, projects become even more sophisticated, aligning with GCSE, A-Level and BTEC coursework. Students often tackle real-world case studies, sometimes in partnership with external organisations or industry experts, preparing them for higher education and the workplace. Preparing Students for the Future Project-based STEAM learning aligns perfectly with the skills demanded by the 21st-century economy. Employers are increasingly seeking individuals who can innovate, adapt, and collaborate. By immersing pupils in real-life scenarios and encouraging them to think outside the box, Sunmarke equips students not only with academic excellence but also with the mindset to become future-ready leaders, creators, and problem-solvers. A Culture of Innovation At Sunmarke, projects aren’t an “add-on” but a core philosophy of learning. They showcase our commitment to Positive Education , where academic success is balanced with character development, wellbeing, and a spirit of innovation. By learning through doing, our students gain confidence in their abilities, pride in their achievements, and the courage to take on new challenges. In essence, Sunmarke’s STEAM projects bring learning to life. They transform abstract theories into tangible experiences, empower pupils to discover their passions, and prepare them to make meaningful contributions in an ever-changing world. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

But at Sunmarke School, we see it as much more. In the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), mathematics is about sparking curiosity, developing confidence, and laying the foundations for a lifetime of learning. Why Early Maths Matters Research shows that early mathematical understanding is a strong predictor of later academic achievement. While the British curriculum formally begins at Key Stage 1, the EYFS framework provides the vital preparation needed to ensure that children transition smoothly and confidently into it. In EYFS, children don’t just learn about numbers – they develop reasoning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition skills, all while making sense of the world around them in playful, meaningful ways. From spotting shapes in their environment to counting blocks during play, children quickly discover that maths is everywhere. At Sunmarke, teachers design experiences that encourage exploration, questioning, and experimentation. This hands-on approach ensures that mathematics feels engaging and relevant right from the start. Making Numbers Fun At Sunmarke, learning maths in EYFS extends beyond the classroom walls and into everyday routines, play, and imagination. For example: Role-play activities: Children might run a pretend shop, counting coins and giving change, or create a picnic in the play kitchen, making sure everyone has an equal share of food. Outdoor learning: Counting steps while climbing, spotting patterns in nature, or building with blocks to understand shapes and symmetry. Songs and rhymes: Classics like Five Little Ducks or One, Two, Buckle My Shoe use rhythm and repetition to help little learners remember number sequences. Storytelling: Stories such as The Very Hungry Caterpillar or Ten Little Superheroes bring abstract mathematical concepts to life in fun, relatable ways. Classroom routines: Tidy-up time becomes a maths opportunity when children organise pencils by colour or sort blocks by shape. Through these everyday experiences, children learn that maths is not something to fear but something to enjoy. Building Confidence and Independence A key principle of the EYFS framework is encouraging children to think critically and solve problems independently. Teachers act as facilitators, guiding pupils to explore solutions rather than providing them directly. For example, when dividing snacks during a pretend picnic, children experience the foundations of division in a natural and enjoyable way. By celebrating effort and progress – not just correct answers – we nurture resilience and confidence. This growth mindset is essential not only for mathematics but also for lifelong learning. Preparing for the Future The EYFS framework is carefully aligned with the British curriculum, ensuring that children develop the skills they need for a successful transition into Key Stage 1 and beyond. By making maths playful, interactive, and meaningful, Sunmarke helps children build both competence and confidence. Our aim is for every child to see numbers not as obstacles but as tools for discovery. With the right encouragement, little learners can develop a genuine love for mathematics and approach “big numbers” with excitement and curiosity. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Our Performing Arts provision, together with the Film & Media and Art & Design faculties, gives students the chance to step into creative spaces where they develop confidence, collaboration, creativity, and communication – skills that will serve them long after the curtain falls. Building Confidence and Self-Expression From their first Nativity in Early Years to major Secondary productions like The Wiz, We Will Rock You, and Little Shop of Horrors, Sunmarke students are given the stage – quite literally – to find their voice. Standing under the lights, delivering lines, or leading a band builds the kind of confidence that transfers seamlessly to presentations, interviews, and leadership roles later in life. Take Emily in Year 9, for example. She began as a shy pupil who joined Drama Club through our Extra Curricular Activities(ECA) programme. Two years later, she was playing a lead role in Mary Poppins, not only mastering stagecraft but also learning how to collaborate, take risks, and speak with conviction – skills her teachers now see reflected in the classroom. Enhancing Communication Skills Performing Arts at Sunmarke goes beyond acting. Pupils explore storytelling, debate, voice projection, and movement, while Film & Media students take on scriptwriting, journalism, podcasting, and video editing. They learn to communicate across multiple platforms – from delivering Shakespearean monologues to producing original short films. These opportunities mean our students leave school not only as articulate thinkers but as versatile communicators who can adapt their message for any audience. Fostering Creativity and Innovation In today’s fast-changing world, creativity is essential. Whether composing original music, choreographing a dance sequence, editing a film trailer, or designing stage sets, students are encouraged to take risks, test ideas, and approach challenges with imagination. Our electives and Extra Curricular Activities(ECA) strengthen this further – from Choir and Orchestra to Film Club and Technical Theatre. These experiences allow students to discover passions, develop talents, and even consider future careers in the arts and creative industries. Developing Teamwork and Leadership Every performance is a team effort. Students step into a range of roles – actors, directors, stage managers, lighting designers, or sound engineers – learning to rely on one another while also taking initiative. This mirrors professional working environments, teaching pupils to collaborate effectively, respect different perspectives, and lead with empathy. Linking Creativity to the Wider Curriculum The Performing Arts are not an isolated subject at Sunmarke – they connect across disciplines. English Literature supports script analysis, History informs costume design and context, while ICT and Media fuel digital storytelling. This interdisciplinary approach helps students see the relevance of their creative projects within a broader academic framework. Preparing Students for the Future Creativity, adaptability, and emotional intelligence are highly valued in today’s world. Careers in law, business, healthcare, and technology all demand the ability to communicate clearly, present persuasively, and work collaboratively. By nurturing these skills through Performing Arts, Film & Media, and Art & Design, Sunmarke ensures its students graduate as high achievers who are also confident, resilient, and future-ready. More Than Performance: A Pathway to Lifelong Skills At Sunmarke, Performing Arts isn’t just about the applause. It’s about the lessons learned on stage, in the rehearsal room, and behind the camera – lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and self-expression. As our students step into the spotlight, they are also stepping into themselves – learning not just how to perform, but how to thrive. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Leading initiatives like recycling stalls, flea markets, and mentoring primary students was incredibly rewarding. These experiences not only nurtured my passion for community service and environmental responsibility but also reinforced the importance of teamwork and collective action. As I move forward to my next chapter, I carry with me the values, leadership experience, and global perspective that Sunmarke has instilled in me. I will always be proud to have represented a community that empowers its students to make a real difference. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Attending Sunmarke from 2018 to 2020 was one of the most formative and exciting chapters of my life, and I’m forever grateful for the foundation it gave me. Achieving Excellence at Sunmarke I left Sunmarke with Straight A* and A grades in my A Levels and a BTEC Media Diploma. The combination of these qualifications equipped me with the skills and confidence I needed to take my next step: enrolling at Cardiff University. In 2020, I began studying Business Administration and Marketing, a course that perfectly matched my interests and ambitions. University Years and Beyond Graduating in 2023 with a 2:1 was a proud moment, marking the end of an incredible journey in the UK. But my heart was always drawn back to Dubai, so in the autumn of 2023, I returned home, eager to begin my career in the dynamic world of Business Development. Breaking into the Business World By November 2023, I had secured my first professional role as a Business Development Manager at KPS, a renowned interior fit-out and design company based in Dubai Design District. This opportunity has been nothing short of amazing. Every day, I learn something new—procurement, logistics, pricing strategies, customer relations, and even brand identity. I feel incredibly fortunate to work in such a creative and fast-paced environment where I can apply everything I’ve learned and continue to grow. Reflections on Sunmarke Looking back, what stands out most about my time at Sunmarke is the exceptional support I received from my teachers. They genuinely cared about my success and always encouraged me to aim high. The small class sizes made a huge difference too—it felt personal, like everyone was invested in my journey. The facilities were outstanding, and the sense of kindness and camaraderie among students and staff made it a joy to come to school every day. Advice for Current Sunmarke Students If I could give one piece of advice to students preparing to enter the professional world, it would be this: expect to learn a lot. The transition from school to the workplace is full of opportunities to grow and develop, so work hard, stay humble, and be grateful for every experience. Most importantly, never miss a chance to make something better—whether it’s your work, a process, or even someone’s day. Looking Ahead As I look to the future, my ultimate goal is to grow into the role of CEO and lead a company to its greatest possible success. I’m passionate about watching businesses thrive, and I can’t wait to see where my journey takes me next. Thank You, Sunmarke Sunmarke School will always hold a special place in my heart. It’s where my ambitions were born, my skills were nurtured, and my path to success was set. Thank you for being the launchpad for my dreams—I wouldn’t be where I am today without you. To all the students at Sunmarke now: the sky’s the limit. Dream big, work hard, and make every moment count. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

I completed my A-Levels in Biology, Chemistry, and Maths, achieving an A* in all three subjects, an A in AS Level Psychology and an A in my Extended Project Qualification. I joined Sunmarke in 2021 at the start of Year 12 after completing my IB MYP exams at a previous school. My time at Sunmarke has been invaluable; the teachers were incredibly supportive, guiding me through everything from academic content to my EPQ and university applications. I also appreciated the numerous spaces within the school that allowed me to connect with friends and classmates. Currently, I am pursuing Medicine and Surgery at Humanitas University in Milan, Italy. My ultimate career goal is to specialize in a specific medical field, and I anticipate discovering my passion during my hospital rotations in my third year. To current Sunmarke students, I would say: As you transition into the professional world, remember that growth often comes with challenges. Initially, navigating independently can be tough, but it becomes easier with time. School is just the first chapter of your journey, but it’s a crucial one in achieving your aspirations. The lessons you learn now will pave the way for your future success. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

I completed my A-Levels in Biology, Chemistry, and Maths, achieving an A* in all three subjects, an A in AS Level Psychology and an A in my Extended Project Qualification. I joined Sunmarke in 2021 at the start of Year 12 after completing my IB MYP exams at a previous school. My time at Sunmarke has been invaluable; the teachers were incredibly supportive, guiding me through everything from academic content to my EPQ and university applications. I also appreciated the numerous spaces within the school that allowed me to connect with friends and classmates. Currently, I am pursuing Medicine and Surgery at Humanitas University in Milan, Italy. My ultimate career goal is to specialize in a specific medical field, and I anticipate discovering my passion during my hospital rotations in my third year. To current Sunmarke students, I would say: As you transition into the professional world, remember that growth often comes with challenges. Initially, navigating independently can be tough, but it becomes easier with time. School is just the first chapter of your journey, but it’s a crucial one in achieving your aspirations. The lessons you learn now will pave the way for your future success. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

I graduated from the school in 2017 after completing my Maths, Physics and Business A-Levels, achieving A*’s in all three subjects. This landed me an offer at the University of Exeter, studying MEng Renewable Energy Engineering on their Cornwall campus. At University, I spent the best 4 years of my life. I learnt all about solar, wind, tidal, and wave energy technologies which made me realise the importance of my degree for our future. This encouraged me to work as a student ambassador for the University, alongside my studies, to encourage other students to study STEM subjects. Living and studying in Cornwall has also been a unique experience as I was surrounded by greenery and the sea. After graduating from the University of Exeter with a First Class Honours in 2021, I was offered a job as a Graduate Engineer at Photon Energy in Reading, UK. I have recently been promoted to an Assistant Engineer, working on the design of commercial rooftop PV systems for large companies in the UK. I have been involved in some of the company’s biggest projects for large food distributors, going on site visits and assisting the delivery of the projects. One of my biggest achievements is the respect and trust I have earned from my colleagues and directors as a result of my hard work and commitment. Throughout my education and work experience, I have grown as an individual as I became more independent. This was influenced by the encouragement I received from my teachers at Sunmarke school who always believed in me and pushed me to apply to University in the UK. In the future, as I gain more experience, I would like to progress to become a project manager, working on large-scale rooftop and ground-mount PV systems around the World. If I could summarise the lessons I learnt throughout my adult life so far, I would emphasise the importance of believing in oneself and stepping outside the comfort zone because this is the only way to find our limits and accomplish our dreams. 0 Shares Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Age requirements will change for new students enroled into FS1, according to the UAE Ministry of Education Resolution no (24). Children enroling into FS1, starting in September, must be three years old on or before the 31st of August. Children enroling into FS2, starting in September, must be four years old on or before the 31st of August. Similarly, children enroling into Year 1, starting school in September, must be five years old on or before the 31st of August. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. This includes students who enrol for the final term of the 2023/24 academic year. Schools that start the academic year in September, in line with MOE Resolution no (24).

When did this change come into effect? This change was applicable from the start of the 2021/22 academic year in September 2021. 3. Why was this change made? This decision was made to bring more consistency to the cut-off dates used by schools in the UAE with those used by schools abroad. For example, UK schools in the UAE will now have the same cut-off date as schools in the UK, and international British schools. 4.Who will this change impact? This change will impact children up to six years old who are enrolling in school for the first time. 5. Will the new cut-off date apply to all year groups? It will apply to new students enrolling in FS1, FS2, Year 1 and Year 2 in all schools in the UAE, as stipulated in the MOE resolution. 6. My child was born in October and is now in FS1 – I want to enrol him in another school for FS2. Can I do this or does he have to repeat a year? Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year – before the changes come into effect – will she be able to start Year 1 next year? Yes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. 9. I’ve already registered and paid the deposit for my daughter to start school in FS2 in September. She will be four years old in November. Is she affected by this? According to the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution, your daughter will not be able to start in FS2 in September. Alternatively, we would be happy to transfer your child’s application to their age-appropriate year group (FS1) and register your child for this year group instead. Parents whose children are affected by the new cut-off dates and who have already paid deposits for their children’s enrolment are entitled to a refund if they wish. 10.

Age requirements will change for new students enroled into FS1, according to the UAE Ministry of Education Resolution no (24). Children enroling into FS1, starting in September, must be three years old on or before the 31st of August. Children enroling into FS2, starting in September, must be four years old on or before the 31st of August. Similarly, children enroling into Year 1, starting school in September, must be five years old on or before the 31st of August. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. This includes students who enrol for the final term of the 2023/24 academic year. Schools that start the academic year in September, in line with MOE Resolution no (24). Year Group Age requirement Foundation Stage 1 3 years old by August 31st Foundation Stage 2 4 years old by August 31st Year 1 5 years old by August 31 Year 2 6 years old by August 31 2. When did this change come into effect? This change was applicable from the start of the 2021/22 academic year in September 2021. 3. Why was this change made? This decision was made to bring more consistency to the cut-off dates used by schools in the UAE with those used by schools abroad. For example, UK schools in the UAE will now have the same cut-off date as schools in the UK, and international British schools. 4.Who will this change impact? This change will impact children up to six years old who are enrolling in school for the first time. 5. Will the new cut-off date apply to all year groups? It will apply to new students enrolling in FS1, FS2, Year 1 and Year 2 in all schools in the UAE, as stipulated in the MOE resolution. 6. My child was born in October and is now in FS1 – I want to enrol him in another school for FS2. Can I do this or does he have to repeat a year? Because your child is already enroled in school, the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution do not apply. He does not have to repeat the year. 7. My son was enroled in FS1 this year but I withdrew his enrolment due to COVID-19. He’ll be 3 years old in September. Can I still enrol him in FS2 next year? Your child must have formally finished the previous academic year in order to enrol in the next one. Since he does not meet the age requirement for FS2 for next academic year, he must enrol in FS1. According to the MOE resolution, he can enrol in FS2 next academic year only if he completes FS1 this academic year. 8. My daughter will be 4 years old in December. If I enrol her in FS2 for the last term of this year – before the changes come into effect – will she be able to start Year 1 next year? Yes. The new age requirements will apply for new students from the start of the next academic year only. The MOE resolution stipulates that all students currently enroled at private schools in the UAE are not affected by the change. 9. I’ve already registered and paid the deposit for my daughter to start school in FS2 in September. She will be four years old in November. Is she affected by this? According to the new cut-off dates in the MOE resolution, your daughter will not be able to start in FS2 in September. Alternatively, we would be happy to transfer your child’s application to their age-appropriate year group (FS1) and register your child for this year group instead. Parents whose children are affected by the new cut-off dates and who have already paid deposits for their children’s enrolment are entitled to a refund if they wish. 10.

What is Year 7 and Year 8 Life skills Pathway? 1. Is it approved by the Ministry of Education? It is a mainstream curriculum, supplemented by ASDAN modules. As it is a supplemented curriculum which focuses on reduced teachers, as per KHDA, there is no need for permission for this pathway as it falls under our current education licence. 2. What are the timings if my son is enroled in this program? The timings are that of the normal school day, unless the student has additional needs or commitments outside of school that need to be met. As a KHDA accredited Rahhal provider, we can review timings to meet the student’s needs. 3. What is the cost for LSA? Costs are an estimate range until all students are enroled. 4. What would be mentioned in the invoice for this program? Is it “Tuition fee”? School fees are billed as normal. Parents will then have to sign a KHDA Individual Service Agreement for the LSA cost. This will then be a separate invoice. 5 How will I enrol my child? Our SENCO will assess the student before we can accept to ensure we can meet their needs in this class. It is a pathway that supports access to the mainstream and we can’t cater for severe needs.

During these formative years, children explore the world around them, develop their imagination, and begin to express their thoughts and emotions in unique ways. Integrating art and creative activities into the EYFS curriculum plays a pivotal role in this developmental journey. Art is more than just drawing or painting—it is a powerful tool that allows children to communicate ideas that they may not yet have the words to express. In EYFS, children are encouraged to experiment with colors, textures, and materials, giving them the freedom to explore and create. This process not only develops fine motor skills but also boosts confidence as children see their ideas come to life. Creativity in early years education is closely linked to cognitive and emotional development. When children engage in art, they learn to make decisions, solve problems, and think critically. For instance, choosing which colors to mix, how to build a structure with blocks, or deciding what story to tell through a drawing all stimulate their brain in meaningful ways. Furthermore, creative activities offer a safe space for children to express emotions, explore feelings, and develop empathy. A child who paints a stormy sky might be working through feelings of frustration or excitement—art becomes a mirror to their inner world. At Sunmarke, our EYFS classrooms are designed to inspire creativity. We provide a rich variety of resources—from paints, clay, and fabrics to natural materials like leaves and shells. Teachers act as facilitators rather than directors, guiding children gently while allowing them the autonomy to explore. This approach encourages independent thinking and celebrates individual expression. Music, drama, and storytelling also play a vital role in nurturing creativity. Singing songs, role-playing, and creating stories enable children to develop language skills, imagination, and social interaction. Collaborative art projects, for example, foster teamwork and communication, helping children learn to share ideas and respect different perspectives. Parents are key partners in this journey. Encouraging children to explore creativity at home, whether through doodling, crafting, or imaginative play, reinforces what they experience at school. At Sunmarke, we actively involve families in celebrating children’s artwork and creative achievements, recognizing that encouragement and appreciation fuel confidence and motivation. Ultimately, fostering art and creativity in EYFS is about more than producing beautiful artwork. It is about empowering children to explore, express, and understand themselves and the world around them. By providing the right environment, resources, and guidance, Sunmarke ensures that every child’s unique voice is heard, celebrated, and nurtured from the very beginning of their educational journey. 0 Shares Prev Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes 21/10/2025 From Passion to Profession: Student-Led Startups & Enterprise Projects at Sunmarke"

It’s more than just a camp…so here’s how the Elite Sports Camp will help your child: 1. Physical activities = health & wellbeing Physical activity can strengthen a child’s muscles and bones, prevent excessive weight gain, and reduce the risk of diseases and other medical conditions, however, physical activity is also beneficial to the mental health of a child. Experts say physical activity allows children to have a better outlook on life by building confidence, managing anxiety and depression, and increasing self-esteem and cognitive skills. “Exercise also releases endorphins, which correlates to a happy child,” said Len Saunders, physical health educator, and author of “Keeping Kids Fit”. Elites Camps are based on the concept that children will be having so much fun, they are unaware at just how much information is being retained to improve their ability. 2. Organised sport ‘improves your School Life’ Organised extracurricular sport activities for children help them develop and improve cognitive skills, such as greater concentration capacity, that can in term greatly help them in the classroom, says Université de Montréal professor Linda Pagani. We agree, as concentration and awareness are massively improved by participating in sport. Our gymnastics games such as ‘Minefield’ promotes concentration to commit to moves that require balance and determination. Within the game we use instructions from team mates to enable them to navigate their way and complete tasks. 3. Social awareness and forming friendships Communication is the foundation of any good relationship. Our ability to communicate effectively and appropriately is how we relate to others and welcome them to understand us. It can be as basic as remembering peoples’ names to engaging in thoughtful conversations. We encourage our kids before they even learn how to talk, how to communicate. We actively encourage students that have been with Elite at previous camps to befriend new students and take them under their wing. Each day we select new teams to encourage the children to meet new children with team games helping to build confidence in teammates and to reinforce how important it is to ‘rely on’ and ‘be reliable’. Some children know how to approach a group and ask to join the fun; for other kids, this doesn’t come to them naturally. Sports is the perfect channel for kids to learn how to approach others and work with them. They learn about the parts that they play. Are they a leader or a role player? They learn about the value of being both when it comes to team sports which they can later apply in life. 4. Leadership & Confidence Discovering how to assert yourself is one of the most challenging skills kids should learn. Just as there are aggressive children; there are kids that are more vulnerable and will often be bullied for it. Sports can help build a child’s confidence and prepare them for later life. Team sports will teach kids the difference between being aggressive and assertive. The competitive atmosphere of sports is a good training ground for building one’s confidence to achieve a goal. Children aged 4 – 14 will enjoy six different activities every day at Elite Sports Camp. The camps focus on fun, team work, communication & technical improvement in a safe and friendly environment. Above all else it’s a great opportunity for the kids to make friends and stay active. Sign them up and speak with our talented and dedicated coaches who will teach sessions in Football, Basketball, Dodgeball, Hockey, Cricket & much more. A physically active child is a healthy child!

While technology has opened countless opportunities for learning, it has also introduced challenges in balancing screen time, maintaining focus, and encouraging independent thinking. For parents navigating this digital landscape, supporting a child’s education at home requires a thoughtful approach. Embrace Technology, but with Purpose Digital tools can be powerful allies in your child’s education. Platforms such as educational apps, online libraries, and virtual classrooms allow children to access knowledge anytime, anywhere. Rather than restricting screen use entirely, aim to make it meaningful. Look for age-appropriate, curriculum-aligned apps and websites that reinforce classroom learning Create a Distraction-Free Learning Environment Home learning doesn’t always mean hours spent in front of a screen. Setting up a quiet, tech-free zone (other than the necessary devices) helps your child focus during homework or revision time. Ensure the area is well-lit, clutter-free, and away from distractions like television or mobile phones. Having a consistent routine and workspace encourages responsibility and better learning habits. Set Healthy Digital Boundaries One of the biggest concerns for modern parents is screen time. Excessive use of devices can impact sleep, mood, and social skills. Set clear rules around when and how long devices can be used, especially for non-educational purposes. Consider using built-in parental controls or screen-time tracking apps. Most importantly, model good digital habits yourself. Children learn from observing adults, so putting your phone away during family meals or reading together in the evening can reinforce balanced behaviour. Stay Connected with Your Child’s School In the digital age, home and school partnerships are more important than ever. Use communication platforms like school apps to stay informed about your child’s progress, assignments, and upcoming events. Don’t hesitate to reach out to teachers for guidance on how to support your child’s learning journey at home. Many schools, including Sunmarke , also host webinars or offer resources for digital parenting. Encourage Curiosity and Offline Exploration Technology should be a tool—not a replacement—for curiosity. Support your child in developing a love of learning that extends beyond screens. Encourage hobbies like reading, drawing, science experiments, sports or playing a musical instrument. Engage in conversations about what they’re learning at school, and let them take the lead in exploring topics they’re passionate about. Parenting in the digital age is about finding balance. With the right strategies and support, you can help your child thrive academically and emotionally in a tech-driven world. By embracing educational technology mindfully, fostering structure and curiosity at home, and staying closely connected with their school, you’ll empower your child to succeed both online and offline. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Starting from FS1 (Foundation Stage 1), mindfulness offers a powerful way to help children recognise, understand, and regulate their emotions, setting the stage for stronger relationships, improved learning , and better mental health. What is Mindfulness? Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present and engaged in the moment without judgement. For young children, this can mean learning to notice their thoughts, feelings, and sensations in a calm and focused way. While the concept may seem advanced, even FS1 students can begin to develop mindfulness through age-appropriate activities such as breathing exercises, sensory play, and guided storytelling. Why Start in FS1? The early years are a critical period in a child’s emotional development. During FS1 and FS2, children begin to explore their emotions, learn how to interact with others, and develop self-awareness. Introducing mindfulness at this age helps lay a strong foundation for emotional intelligence by teaching children how to name their feelings, and respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively. At Sunmarke School, our Positive Education and wellbeing programmes embed these principles early on, creating an emotionally supportive environment for every child. Benefits of Mindfulness for Young Learners Improved Focus and Concentration: Simple mindfulness practices help children develop their attention span, which supports academic success and better classroom behaviour. Emotional Regulation: Children learn to identify their emotions and use calming techniques such as deep breathing or counting to manage strong feelings like frustration, sadness, or excitement. Reduced Anxiety and Stress: Mindfulness creates space for calm and reflection, helping even the youngest learners cope with changes, transitions, or separation anxiety. Better Social Skills: Mindful practices encourage empathy, kindness, and listening—key traits for making friends and building healthy relationships. Mindfulness Activities Mindful Listening: Play nature sounds or soft music and ask children to describe what they hear. This sharpens focus and brings awareness to the present moment. Feelings Check-In: Use emotion cards or visuals to help children express how they’re feeling. This builds emotional vocabulary and self-awareness. Gratitude Circles: A simple morning circle time activity where each child shares something they’re thankful for. Building a Culture of Emotional Intelligence When schools and families work together to integrate mindfulness into daily routines, it becomes second nature. Practising mindfulness doesn’t require a lot of time, just consistency, encouragement, and a safe space for children to explore their feelings. By starting in FS1, we give children the tools to build resilience, empathy, and emotional maturity that will benefit them for life. At Sunmarke , we believe emotional intelligence is just as important as academic success—and it begins with mindfulness. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

In Dubai’s diverse education landscape, terms like FS1 (Foundation Stage 1) and KG1 (Kindergarten 1) are widely used, but what do they actually mean, and how do they differ? At Sunmarke School , we follow the British Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) curriculum , offering FS1 and FS2. This blog explores the differences between FS and KG1 across various curricula and helps you understand which path might be best for your child. What is FS (Foundation Stage)? FS1 (ages 3–4) and FS2 (ages 4–5) are part of the British curriculum’s Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) . This framework is designed around seven key areas of learning and development, including: Communication and Language Personal, Social and Emotional Development Physical Development Literacy Mathematics Understanding the World Expressive Arts and Design At Sunmarke School, FS2 (equivalent in age to KG1) offers a play-based, inquiry-led approach , encouraging creativity, curiosity, and confidence in a nurturing environment. The focus is on developing the whole child, not just academic readiness. What is KG1? Kindergarten 1 (KG1) generally refers to the first official year of early childhood education for children aged 4 to 5 across a variety of curricula. Here’s how KG1 typically appears in different educational systems: American Curriculum: KG1 is often the first of two kindergarten years (KG1 and KG2) and leans more towards structured, academic readiness in literacy and numeracy. Indian Curriculum (CBSE/ICSE): KG1 is commonly referred to as Lower Kindergarten (LKG), where early academic skills are introduced through more structured teaching. IB PYP (International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme): Early Years in the IB system may also be referred to as KG1 in some schools, focusing on transdisciplinary, inquiry-based learning similar to EYFS but with international themes. Other Asian or blended systems: KG1 may vary slightly but usually includes a mix of formal instruction and play. FS2 vs KG1: Key Differences Feature Foundation Stage (FS2) – British EYFS Kindergarten 1 (KG1) – Various Curricula Curriculum British (EYFS) American, Indian, IB, etc. Learning Approach Child-led, play-based More structured (varies by curriculum) Focus Holistic development Early academics + developmental skills Assessment Observational, developmental profiles Mix of informal/formal assessments Age Group FS2: 4–5 years KG1: 4–5 years Why Choose FS at Sunmarke School? At Sunmarke , our EYFS Foundation Stage focuses on nurturing each child’s individuality. Our FS2 programme prepares students with strong foundations in literacy, numeracy, communication, emotional wellbeing, and social skills, all through joyful, meaningful experiences. Children learn through structured play , hands-on exploration, music, movement, art, outdoor learning, and early phonics and maths. This creates a balanced learning journey where children are academically prepared yet emotionally secure and socially confident. Building Strong Foundations for Life Whether you are comparing FS2 with KG1 in Dubai or exploring top-rated British curriculum schools, Sunmarke School offers an early years experience where every child is nurtured, inspired, and empowered to thrive. Visit us today to see how our FS classrooms are filled with laughter, learning, and limitless possibilities. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Yet research continues to affirm what many educators have always known: a child’s earliest learning experiences form the foundation for everything that follows . That’s why the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) isn’t just a starting point—it’s the launchpad for lifelong learning, wellbeing and personal growth. At forward-thinking schools like Sunmarke, the EYFS isn’t simply about preparing children for Year 1—it’s about nurturing curiosity, developing essential life skills, and building confident, independent young learners through a blend of play, discovery, and guided learning. A Curriculum That Respects How Young Children Learn The EYFS framework in the UK, followed by leading international schools in Dubai and beyond, is grounded in the understanding that children learn best when they feel safe, engaged, and valued . The curriculum focuses on seven key areas of development, from communication and language to physical development and understanding the world. In practice, this means an environment rich in storytelling, role play, sensory exploration, and problem-solving activities . At Sunmarke, for instance, you’ll find children immersed in everything from phonics and number songs to planting seeds, experimenting with textures, or acting out imaginative stories—all under the guidance of caring educators who observe, extend and scaffold learning in real time. Learning Through Play – With Purpose In the EYFS, play isn’t a break from learning, it i s the learning. Children develop critical thinking, collaboration, and emotional regulation through imaginative and structured play. Whether building with blocks, negotiating roles in a game, or investigating bugs in the outdoor classroom, every moment of play is carefully designed to support a child’s progress and interests. At Sunmarke, the integration of play with purpose is elevated through access to modern facilities, highly trained staff, and an innovative curriculum that promotes inquiry and creativity. Children are encouraged to ask questions, explore solutions, and follow their own learning pathways. A Holistic Approach to Growth The early years are about far more than academic readiness. It’s during this time that children begin to develop the social, emotional and physical skills that will shape how they approach school and life. With a strong focus on emotional wellbeing and character building, Sunmarke’s EYFS framework ensures that children feel secure, supported and capable . Through positive relationships and well-planned routines, children learn to manage emotions, build friendships, and grow in independence. The school’s commitment to character education and positive education (PosEd) is embedded from the very start, helping even the youngest learners to build resilience, empathy, and a love for learning. A Strong Start Leads to a Strong Future Numerous studies have shown that high-quality early years education leads to better academic performance, stronger social skills, and higher levels of self-esteem later in life. When children feel confident, capable and curious from a young age, they are far more likely to flourish as they move through school and beyond. Schools like Sunmarke understand this. Their EYFS provision is not only aligned with the highest standards but also enriched by specialist programmes, outdoor learning experiences, and an inclusive, nurturing ethos that celebrates every child’s unique journey. The early years matter, not just for school readiness, but for setting the emotional, social and cognitive foundation for life. In an ever-changing world, children need more than academic skills. They need creativity, confidence, resilience and curiosity and the best EYFS settings are where those qualities take root. If you’re a parent exploring early years education, look for a setting where your child is seen, heard, and inspired every day. Because those early footsteps are the ones that shape a lifelong path. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

A Pathway to Global Universities The IB Diploma is accepted by leading universities across the world. At Sunmarke, our IBDP graduates consistently gain admission to top-tier universities, thanks to the programme’s strong academic foundation and international credibility. University admissions officers value the IBDP because it develops well-rounded students who can think critically, write effectively, and manage their own learning. Our Sunmarke students exceed the expectations of competitive university environments. Academic Breadth and Depth Unlike other post-16 programmes, the IBDP requires students to study six subjects across a range of disciplines—ensuring a balanced education while allowing for specialisation in three higher-level subjects. This balance enables students to keep their university options open while demonstrating advanced knowledge in areas of interest. At Sunmarke, students benefit from expert faculty, small class sizes, and personalised academic mentoring that helps them excel in all subject groups—from the sciences and mathematics to the humanities and the arts. Core Components that Build University Ready Skills What truly distinguishes the IBDP is its core: Theory of Knowledge (TOK) , the Extended Essay (EE) , and Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) . These components cultivate vital university-level skills: TOK encourages students to explore how knowledge is constructed, enhancing their critical thinking abilities. The EE is a 4,000-word research project, fostering independent research, academic writing, and analytical skills essential for university coursework. CAS pushes students beyond academics, encouraging real-world engagement and social responsibility through community service, creative pursuits, and physical challenges. Global Perspective, Personal Growth The IB’s learner profile aligns seamlessly with Sunmarke’s vision of developing innovative thinkers and compassionate leaders. Through the IBDP, students grow into inquisitive, reflective, and principled individuals ready to thrive in multicultural university settings. Our diverse student body and international outlook ensure that Sunmarke students graduate with a global mindset, an increasingly sought-after trait in higher education and the workforce. Success Beyond the Diploma At Sunmarke, our alumni go on to excel in their academic and professional journeys, often returning to share how the IBDP gave them a head start in life. If you’re considering university pathways for your child, the IB Diploma Programme at Sunmarke School Dubai offers unmatched preparation for academic excellence and lifelong success.

To prepare young people for life beyond the classroom, schools are increasingly turning to a variety of enrichment programmes. For example, Sunmarke School offers its Signature and Fortes 360 programmes—tailored experiences designed to nurture the whole child. These initiatives not only deepen academic understanding but also build character, creativity, resilience, and real-world readiness. Why These Programmes Matter Traditional schooling models have long focused on academic rigour. While this remains important, it is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. Holistic education—which includes emotional intelligence, life skills, career readiness, and global awareness—is now considered essential for success in the 21st century. This is where Sunmarke School’s Signature and Fortes 360 programmes come in. Whether it’s career development, sports, STEAM and innovation, or leadership engagement, these structured, school-wide initiatives provide meaningful learning opportunities that equip students to thrive—not just in exams, but in life. 1. Early Career Exposure Children today are entering a world filled with both opportunities and uncertainties. Offering them a glimpse into various industries through structured internships, job shadowing, or even student-led podcasts helps them explore their strengths, build communication skills, and make informed decisions about their futures. Schools that offer early career development initiatives foster confidence, self-awareness, and ambition—qualities that can’t be taught through theory alone. 2. Leadership and Industry Exposure Developing leadership skills in students goes far beyond assigning roles in school councils or group projects. True leadership flourishes when young people are exposed to real-world perspectives and are given the chance to engage meaningfully with professionals from diverse sectors. Programmes like Think & Thrive at Sunmarke School allow students to participate in panel discussions, Q&A sessions, and fireside chats with leaders from various industries. These experiences foster critical thinking, boost public speaking skills, and offer invaluable insights into global issues and career landscapes. When students are encouraged to step into the role of interviewer or discussion facilitator, they gain not just confidence, but also the curiosity and communication skills essential for future leadership—whether in boardrooms, classrooms, or community spaces. 3. Multilingual and Global Mindset In an increasingly connected world, exposure to global languages and cultures is no longer optional—it’s essential. Language academies that blend cultural immersion with STEAM and project-based learning help young learners become open-minded global citizens. These initiatives prepare students to collaborate across borders—both literally and intellectually. 4. Innovation Through STEAM & Design Thinking Encouraging curiosity and creative problem-solving through STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) has become a cornerstone of modern education. Sunmarke School’s STEAM programme includes robotics, sustainability projects, design sprints, and even AI and VR integration. These immersive experiences allow children to tackle real-world problems, preparing them for careers that may not yet exist. 5. Flexible Academic Pathways Every child learns differently. Schools that offer flexible curriculum pathways—such as A-Levels, the IB Diploma, or BTEC options—empower students to follow personalised academic journeys. When paired with strong mentoring and coaching initiatives, this approach fosters clarity, purpose, and motivation—all key ingredients for lifelong success. 6. Environmental Responsibility and Outdoor Learning Education also involves nurturing responsible stewards of the planet. At Sunmarke School our Forest School sessions, sustainability challenges, and hydroponics labs bring environmental learning to life. These experiences ignite an early appreciation for nature and encourage students to think critically about their role in building a more sustainable future. The Real Value: Preparing for Life, Not Just School What truly sets these programmes apart is the real-life relevance they bring to education. From digital fluency in AI to collaboration in design challenges, students develop transferable skills that will serve them in university, the workplace, and beyond. Schools offering such comprehensive programmes are better positioned to develop students who are not only academically capable but also emotionally resilient, socially aware, and future-ready. When considering a school for your child, it’s important to look beyond rankings and exam results. Ask yourself: Does this school develop the whole child? Does it offer enriching experiences beyond the classroom? Some of the most forward-thinking schools, particularly those recognised for innovation and student wellbeing, embed diverse programmes as a core part of their educational model. In a world that’s constantly changing, these initiatives ensure that our children aren’t just keeping up, they’re leading the way. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

The right environment can shape not just academic success, but also emotional wellbeing, social confidence, and future aspirations. With a wide variety of curricula and schools in the UAE, particularly in Dubai, the process can feel overwhelming. This complete guide will walk you through the key considerations from curriculum options and teaching quality to pastoral care and future readiness. Step 1: Understand the Different Curricula One of the first things to consider is the curriculum. The most common ones offered in Dubai include: British Curriculum (National Curriculum for England) : Offers a structured approach with internationally recognised qualifications like IGCSEs and A-Levels. IB (International Baccalaureate) : Focuses on inquiry-based learning, global awareness, and student independence. American Curriculum : Offers flexibility and broad subject choices with a focus on continuous assessment. Indian Curriculum (CBSE/ICSE) : Strong in maths and science, with a rigorous approach. Other options : French, German, and bilingual schools are also available. Sunmarke School , for instance, offers a choice of A-Level, the IB Diploma Programme and BTEC , allowing students to pursue the pathway best suited to their strengths and aspirations. Step 2: Think About Your Child’s Learning Style and Interests Every child learns differently. Some thrive in academically rigorous environments, while others excel in creative, inquiry-driven settings. At Sunmarke , the focus is on a holistic approach that nurtures academic achievement alongside emotional intelligence, leadership, entrepreneurship, mindfulness and character development. This is especially important in a rapidly evolving world where adaptability and emotional resilience matter just as much as grades. Step 3: Assess Academic Results and University Destinations Academic performance remains a key consideration. It’s important to review a school’s examination outcomes, as well as its university acceptances and alumni success stories. Sunmarke School has distinguished itself in this regard, ranking 68th globally and 3rd in the UAE for IB education , with exceptional academic results and offers from some of the world’s most prestigious universities. Step 4: Explore Facilities and Extra-Curricular Opportunities A great school offers more than just academics. Modern, well-equipped campuses and rich co-curricular programmes help students discover their passions, whether in sports, arts, technology or community service. Sunmarke stands out with its world-class facilities – including innovation labs, a STEAM centre, performing arts studios, and Olympic-standard sports infrastructure. Its Signature Programmes such as STEAM & Design Thinking, Careers Development Programme, and Performing Arts give students unique opportunities to explore and excel beyond the classroom. Step 5: Evaluate Teacher Quality and Wellbeing Support Exceptional teachers are the cornerstone of any successful school. Seek out a school that prioritises hiring skilled, passionate educators and supports them with continuous professional development. At Sunmarke , our teachers are not only experts in their fields but are also trained in Positive Education , empowering students to develop resilience, optimism, and strong emotional wellbeing. This focus on pastoral care and mental health sets Sunmarke apart as a leader in nurturing well-rounded, confident individuals. Our dedicated team includes two full-time counsellors who provide expert support to both students and parents through one-to-one sessions and wellbeing workshops designed to strengthen family connections and emotional wellness. Step 6: Think Long-Term: Sixth Form and Career Preparation It’s important to consider how a school supports students in their later years, whether through strong Sixth Form programmes, university counselling, or industry exposure. Sunmarke School offers an outstanding Sixth Form , with pathways including A-Levels , BTEC, and IB. The school’s Career-Related Programme prepares students with real-world work experience, internships, and mentoring, ensuring they are future-ready . Step 7: Visit the School and Talk to the Community No guide is complete without encouraging you to visit potential schools. Attend open days, speak to teachers, observe classrooms, and get a feel for the school’s culture. Parents consistently speak of the warmth, academic rigour and forward-thinking ethos at Sunmarke , making it one of the top schools in Dubai for families who want the very best. In a competitive education landscape, Sunmarke School sets itself apart by blending academic excellence , innovative programmes , and a strong focus on wellbeing and character . It’s a school where students don’t just learn — they thrive . So, as you consider how to choose the right school and curriculum, take the time to reflect on your child’s needs, visit campuses, and prioritise a future-ready education. For many families, Sunmarke School has become that perfect choice — a place where potential is nurtured and dreams take flight. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

As technology rapidly evolves, we are committed to equipping our learners with the skills, mindset and values to thrive in a world shaped by artificial intelligence and future technologies. From AI-powered revision tools to ethical debates on emerging tech, our students aren’t just observing the future, they’re actively building it. AI and Future Technologies in Action At Sunmarke, students experience artificial intelligence not as a distant concept, but as an everyday tool for exploration and creativity. Our bespoke AI learning platforms are designed to personalise each student’s academic journey. These systems identify patterns in learning behaviour, offering tailored feedback and support that strengthen both metacognitive awareness and analytical thinking ( Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR )), essential competencies in an AI-driven world. Learning by Creating: The Power of STEAM Through Sunmarke’s pioneering STEAM & Design Thinking Programme , students engage in interdisciplinary learning that blends science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. Here, learning is centred on discovery, experimentation, and invention. Pupils develop real-world problem-solving skills by following the engineering design process – defining challenges, brainstorming solutions, prototyping innovations, and iterating ideas. Along the way, they build proficiency in vital technical skills, including coding, electronics, robotics, and systems thinking. In one outstanding example, a group of Year 12 students recently developed an AI-powered revision website , designed to deliver personalised learning experiences tailored to each user’s performance and needs. This project is not only a showcase of technical skill, but also of initiative, teamwork, and enterprise, the very qualities we cultivate in our students. Ethical Awareness and Responsible Innovation With great technological power comes great responsibility. At Sunmarke, we ensure that students don’t just learn how to use AI – they also ask why . Ethical discussions are embedded into our curriculum, helping students consider the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and automation. Our learners are encouraged to view themselves as future developers, innovators, and change-makers , equipped to lead the creation of technologies that make a meaningful difference in the world. We guide them to combine innovation with empathy, creativity with critical thinking, and technical ability with ethical leadership. The Sunmarke Edge By engaging with AI and future technologies across all levels of school life, Sunmarke students become confident, competent, and future-ready . They’re not waiting for tomorrow’s challenges – they’re preparing to meet them head-on, with curiosity, courage and a clear sense of purpose. Sunmarke’s commitment to innovation, coupled with our strong values-based foundation, ensures that our students are not only technologically adept but also compassionate global citizens ready to lead in a rapidly changing world.

In the UAE, the schooling landscape is rich and diverse, offering a range of curricula and school levels that cater to both local and expatriate families. At Sunmarke School , we aim to support families through every stage of their child’s educational journey. In this guide, we’ll break down the school levels in the UAE, helping you make informed decisions about your child’s academic path. Understanding the Structure The UAE’s education system typically mirrors international standards but is influenced by the local Ministry of Education guidelines. Most private schools in the UAE – including Sunmarke – follow international curricula such as the British, American, IB, or Indian systems. For clarity, here’s how school levels generally align, particularly within the British curriculum: Early Years (Ages 3-5) Foundation Stage 1 (FS1) and Foundation Stage 2 (FS2) Focuses on play-based learning, personal development, and basic literacy and numeracy. Equivalent to preschool and kindergarten in other systems. Primary School (Ages 5-11) Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2) and Key Stage 2 (Years 3-6) Builds core skills in English, Maths, Science, and introduces subjects like History, Geography, Art, and ICT. Emphasis is placed on enquiry-based learning and skill development. Secondary School (Ages 11-16) Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9) and Key Stage 4 (Years 10-11) Key Stage 3 further expands subject knowledge, encouraging critical thinking. Key Stage 4 culminates in GCSE/IGCSE examinations, a pivotal academic milestone. Post-16 Education (Ages 16-18) Sixth Form (Years 12-13) Students pursue either A Levels or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). Prepares students for university admission globally. At Sunmarke School, we offer A-Level , the IB Diploma Programme and BTEC, allowing students to tailor their academic pathway according to their strengths and aspirations. Curriculum Diversity in the UAE While Sunmarke follows the British curriculum, the UAE offers a variety of schooling options: British Curriculum: Widely adopted, offering globally recognised qualifications (GCSEs, A Levels). American Curriculum: Based on a credit system, leading to a High School Diploma. International Baccalaureate (IB): Emphasises global-mindedness and independent thinking. Indian Curriculum (CBSE/ICSE): Structured and exam-oriented, popular among the Indian expat community. Key Considerations for Parents When choosing the right school level or curriculum, consider the following: Your child’s learning style and interests Future university goals Mobility plans – will your child transfer internationally? School environment and teaching philosophy Supporting Your Child’s Journey at Sunmarke At Sunmarke School, we’re more than an academic institution – we’re a community. We offer a holistic education that nurtures academic excellence, character development, and wellbeing.

This phase is pivotal in shaping a child’s future learning, laying the groundwork for academic, social and emotional development. Understanding the EYFS Framework The EYFS framework is structured around seven areas of learning and development, divided into three prime areas and four specific areas: Prime Areas: Communication and Language – Fostering listening skills, comprehension and expressive language Physical Development – Enhancing gross and fine motor skills, coordination and overall physical health Personal, Social and Emotional Development – Cultivating self-awareness, confidence and interpersonal skills Specific Areas: Literacy – Developing reading and writing abilities Mathematics – Introducing concepts of numbers, patterns and spatial understanding. Understanding the World – Encouraging exploration of the environment, technology and diverse cultures Expressive Arts and Design – Promoting creativity through art, music and imaginative play These areas are interwoven to provide a holistic approach to early learning, ensuring children are well prepared for the next stages of their education. Age Groups and Developmental Milestones The early years framework recognises that children develop at their own pace. However, it provides general milestones to guide educators and parents: Birth to 3 Years (Nursery): Focus on sensory exploration, developing trust through secure relationships and beginning to communicate needs and feelings 3 to 4 Years (Pre-K/FS1): Children start to engage more with peers, develop basic language skills and show curiosity about the world around them 4 to 5 Years (KG1/FS2): Emphasis on preparing for formal education, including early reading and numeracy skills, understanding routines and fostering independence It’s essential to remember that these milestones are guidelines. Each child’s development is unique and flexibility within the framework allows for personalised learning experiences. The Role of Play in Learning Play is central to the EYFS approach, serving as a vital mechanism through which children explore, experiment and understand their environment. Through play, children develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills and social interactions. Activities such as role-playing, building with blocks or storytelling not only entertain but also contribute to cognitive and emotional growth. Educators are encouraged to create stimulating environments that offer diverse play opportunities both structured and unstructured. Sunmarke School’s Approach to EYFS At Sunmarke School , Dubai, the early years are embraced with a commitment to nurturing each child’s potential. The school integrates the British EYFS framework with innovative teaching methods focusing on: Child-Initiated Learning: Encouraging children to take the lead in their learning journey, fostering autonomy and confidence Play-Based Curriculum: Utilising imaginative and creative play to enhance learning experiences Positive Education Ethos: Instilling a growth mindset and resilience from an early age Sunmarke’s EYFS department is designed to be a safe, engaging and inspiring environment where children feel valued and motivated to learn. The school’s approach ensures a seamless transition from early years to primary education, laying a robust foundation for lifelong learning. Conclusion The Foundation Phase, as outlined in the EYFS framework, is a critical period in a child’s educational journey. By understanding the age-specific milestones and the importance of play in learning, educators and parents can provide the support necessary for children to thrive. Sunmarke School exemplifies how a well-implemented EYFS curriculum can lead to outstanding outcomes, preparing children not just academically but also socially and emotionally for the future. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

One of the most widely recognised frameworks in education identifies three primary types of learning: visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. Each style reflects a unique way in which individuals process and retain information. Understanding these types of learning can help tailor educational experiences that are more effective and engaging for every child. 1. Visual Learning Visual learners absorb information best when it is presented through images, diagrams, charts, or written directions. They often benefit from seeing information mapped out, and tend to remember what they observe more than what they hear. These learners may enjoy activities such as drawing, mind-mapping, watching videos, or working with infographics. At schools that promote innovation and creativity, such as Sunmarke , visual learning is integrated into daily teaching through interactive whiteboards, multimedia presentations and project-based learning — all of which help bring concepts to life visually. 2. Auditory Learning Auditory learners prefer to listen. They learn best through spoken information, whether it’s a lecture, discussion, podcast, or verbal instruction. These students tend to excel when they can engage in conversations, read aloud, or explain ideas to others. To support auditory learners, classrooms often include storytelling, group discussions, language-rich activities and opportunities for presentation and debate. Environments that encourage communication and collaborative learning, as seen in many forward-thinking schools, help auditory learners thrive. 3. Kinaesthetic Learning Kinaesthetic or tactile learners prefer hands-on experiences. They grasp concepts more effectively when they can move, touch, build or physically interact with their learning materials. These students might struggle with sitting still for long periods but shine in practical tasks, experiments, and active play. Schools that promote whole-child development understand the importance of movement and real-world learning. Through STEAM labs, outdoor education, role play, and physical activities, kinaesthetic learners are given ample opportunities to engage in meaningful, embodied learning. A Balanced Approach While many students may show a preference for one particular learning style, it’s important to recognise that most children are multimodal learners — they benefit from a mix of visual, auditory and kinaesthetic experiences. A holistic, personalised approach to education that draws on all three types of learning can foster deeper understanding, stronger engagement, and long-term academic success. Conclusion Recognising the three main types of learning can help educators and parents support students more effectively, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential. Schools that embrace differentiated instruction and celebrate diverse learning styles — as part of a broader commitment to nurturing character, wellbeing and future readiness — stand at the forefront of modern education. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

At this vital stage, developing strong learning behaviours plays a crucial role in how students engage with their education and the world around them. Here are some key learning behaviours that are essential in shaping success in primary school: Curiosity and a Love for Learning: Children are naturally inquisitive and, when their curiosity is nurtured, they become more engaged and motivated learners. Encouraging students to ask questions, explore new ideas and take initiative in their learning helps build a mindset where they see learning as a lifelong journey rather than a destination. Resilience and Growth Mindset: Learning is not always a smooth path. Mistakes are inevitable but the ability to persevere through challenges is what leads to real growth. A resilient child understands that setbacks are part of the process and embraces the idea that intelligence and ability can develop with effort and practice. Independence and Self-Regulation: As children progress through primary school, they begin to take more responsibility for their own learning. This includes organising their work, managing their time effectively and understanding how they learn best. Developing independence prepares students not just for future academic stages but also for real-world situations where initiative and self-direction are key. Collaboration and Social Skills: Success in school – and beyond – often depends on how well individuals work with others. Learning how to communicate effectively, listen actively, share ideas and resolve differences constructively are essential skills. Primary school offers many opportunities for children to collaborate in group tasks, projects and discussions, all of which help foster empathy, respect and teamwork. Reflective Thinking: Encouraging students to think about their learning — what went well, what could be improved and how to approach things differently next time — helps build a reflective mindset. This self-awareness leads to deeper understanding, more meaningful learning and stronger personal accountability. Creativity and Critical Thinking: Learning isn’t just about remembering facts — it’s about making connections, solving problems and thinking in new ways. Schools that encourage creative expression and analytical thinking help students become more adaptable, open-minded and capable of navigating complex challenges. Fostering the Right Environment A supportive and stimulating environment is essential to nurturing these behaviours. Teachers play a central role in modelling positive habits and creating learning experiences that challenge and inspire. At schools like Sunmarke , there is a strong emphasis on character education, wellbeing and innovative teaching approaches that cater to individual strengths and learning styles. When students are encouraged to be curious, resilient, independent, collaborative, reflective and creative, they are not just prepared for academic success — they are equipped to thrive in all aspects of life. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

A Guide for Parents Why study A Levels Advanced Level qualifications (known as A Levels) are individual subject-based qualifications. They are one option available to students who are looking to study at university. With A Levels being standalone qualifications, there is no requirement on subject combinations and students’ only constraint is the combinations available within the school timetable. A Levels are graded from A*-E. What does this Pathway look like? Students will usually take 3 or 4 A Levels and this would be what universities would be looking for as offers are based mainly on 3 A Level grades. If you are debating which subjects to choose, we recommend you start with 4 A Levels so you can have a range to begin with which you can narrow down later. Students will receive 6 lessons per subject each week with most subjects being 100% examination-based. Subjects either fit into the category of modular A Levels or linear A Levels. In modular subjects, students will take up to three exams in Year 12 and up to three in Year 13 whereas, with linear A Levels, students complete all exams at the end of Year 13. How does this Pathway lead to University? A Levels are internationally recognised qualifications which will give you access to the most competitive universities worldwide. While taking A Levels would give you the necessary prerequisites with regards to subjects, you may need to take further tests in English in order to study at universities where courses are delivered in English. In addition, students wishing to study certain subjects worldwide need to review the Mathematics requirements for entry into the university of their choice. Students wishing to apply to particularly competitive universities should consider taking 4 A Level subjects. What skills will I develop? Taking a combination of A Levels will allow you to specialise in a particular area post 16 as opposed to waiting until you begin university. With few subjects having coursework components, there is a lot of focus on exam skills. However, there is the option of taking the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in order to develop your academic writing and research skills. Competitive universities often place value on the completion of the EPQ as the skills developed through the EPQ translate well into university requirements. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

We’re moving abroad – should we take the children or leave them at boarding school? Prior to becoming a Head, my experience as a boarding housemaster and as a manager of boarding houses has given me a first-hand understanding of the trials and tribulations of this conundrum. Leaving your child at a boarding school is never easy and not a decision that should be made lightly. Taking them with you retains the beauty of family life, love, encouragement, and safety, as well as offering the potential exposure to a new culture. However, for some such massive change, where they leave familiar surroundings and potentially long established friendship groups, causes huge disruption to their world. Key to any change is ‘buy in’ or understanding from all parties rather than aggressive responses and a hatred of their new surroundings: it really can be a fight or flight reaction. Some young people will profess to not wanting to be part of a new experience or, from another perspective our adult interpretation may assume they will not cope with such upheaval. However, never underestimate their resilience and ability to adapt. There are many questions a family should explore and discuss before finally making their decision. In years gone by, leaving them at boarding school seemed a rather draconian method. Utilizing my experience,from working and leading within these environments, may go some way to start to manage or even influence your opinion. Today, boarding schools have spent vast sums upgrading facilities; in many cases in the twenty-first century boarding environments the Sixth Form will have en-suite facilities, dorms will cater for a maximum of 4 and in some cases, individual study rooms are available for pupils from Year 10. Facilities too are now a vital factor as to avoid and culture gap on arrival integration and induction through activities and house events are a prerequisite of any good boarding school. The right choice is vital, as the needs of your son or daughter must be catered for both in and out of the class; there exists a diverse range to suit all needs. I feel that boarding at the right school, will prepare every student for university more comprehensively and let them begin to discover themselves, develop greater maturity in social situations, as well as start to have a really positive effect on an individual’s confidence and self-esteem. Most will boast a caring community and a family atmosphere (and I add it is true in so many cases) but I would insist you visit where possible and ask the students already present in the school: see it in action for yourself. Equally, if you are browsing I would highly recommend the Boarding Schools’ Association websites( http://www.boarding.org.uk/ or http://www.boarding.org.au/ ) to explore and understand what options you have as parents and what you may expect, through a clear outline of the plethora of opportunities that exist in twenty-first-century boarding environments. Good luck with your search and making the right decision with your son/daughter!

Specifically, studies show the more books in the home, the better those children do in school. It made a lot of sense to me at the time and seemed rather obvious; if a lot of quality books were made available to children, they would likely be read to more often. Furthermore, those parents likely placed a heavier emphasis on reading and held a deeper understanding of its early benefits. The study struck such a chord with me that many years later and at six months pregnant, I created a children’s library for the nursery. I bought a bookshelf and took one hundred dollars with me to a discount book store. I filled up all the shelves before my first child was even on this earth. As my family increased over the years, I made sure all of my kids had their own library. I added books along the way to meet their interests and developmental stages. I placed a heavy emphasis on reading aloud, always reading with them at night and as much as I could during the day. I taught them as many early literacy skills as possible during this time (text goes left to right, using pictures as clues, asking what they thought was going to happen or what the problem in the story was). Reading Aloud Has Its Benefits Reading aloud with children had always come naturally to me but a crash course in college and putting the skills into practice in the classroom allowed me to learn there is a stark difference between reading with kids and reading to kids. The craft, being able to engage a young reader so they can get the most out of the literature experience can be learned by any adult. But whether you are reading to a child or with a child, one thing is clear. Scientists and doctors can now biologically prove that when children hear books read aloud, the chemical makeup of their brain actually changes. Early Literacy Improves Academic Progress Numerous studies have been done to show the benefits of early literacy and how its immersion ties into academic progress. But, a new study shows the “why.” It’s been something scientists and doctors have been wanting to prove for a while now. Most compelling is that this study has more than just observation-based data. Doctors and scientists now have scientific proof that the developing brain of a 3-5-year-old actually looks different when being read aloud to, dependent upon on how much the child has been read to in the past. “The MRIs revealed that children from more stimulating home reading environments had greater activity in the parts of the brain that help with narrative comprehension and visual imagery. Their brains showed greater activity in those key areas while they listened to stories.” From nine months of age, my girls have had a book read to them nearly every night before bed and often had two or three books read aloud to them during the day. My oldest is in the 99th percentile for her vocabulary and my four-year-old is as precocious as they come. I absolutely attribute their speech and language, comprehension, above grade level reading level, oral retelling and contextual understanding to one thing…being read to aloud daily. Good Reading Habits Show Up in Early Age Early on in the school year teachers can often pinpoint which children have had a literacy rich background and which one’s have not (excluding children with suspected disabilities). Children who have not had books read to them often have lower comprehension skills, lower vocabulary skills and present with weaker reading stamina. Of course with anything and anyone, there will always be an exception to that rule but the statistics are telling. If you want the best chance for your child’s academic (and even social) success, carve out as much time as you can for exposure to literature. Go to the library or bookstore and bring home books, lots of them. Libraries often have a check-out limit that goes well over one hundred books. This means you don’t have to make a weekly trip; every few weeks is plenty and can be worked into a realistic busy schedule. Getting these books into your home and then reading them aloud is the number one key to creating a literature rich environment. Look at it as front-loading. I realized very quickly I would be far more capable of helping my children at the ages of three or five years of age than I would when they were failing high school chemistry or Algebra II. I hope by giving my children the needed tools when they are young, they will be better prepared for the future. Thank science for its findings later but for now, make a plan to make your home more literature-based. At least once a day, tell your child to put down the iPad and pick up a book. Kids need to remember that reading is not only an option but a necessity. And remember, there are more benefits to reading aloud with your child than just the academic successes that will come. The time spent one-on-one makes it even better. Adding daily read-aloud to your family’s routine is something you will never regret doing, sadly the regrets only come with the opposite. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

The trick towards effective personal development is to discover the methods that work for you. All individuals are unique, and different things work for different people. There are always tips, like these, that can allow you to improve yourself. A great way to improve one’s self-confidence is to prescribe to an exercise routine. The positive energy from working out and the rewarding feeling of going to a gym can help one’s self-esteem tremendously. Sometimes all it takes to feel better is an improved sense of self-worth. Make a list of past instances in which you were able to successfully overcome peer pressure to make your own decisions, with successful results. Confidence in your own intuition can make you a better, wiser, and more invested decision-maker. It also guarantees that you will be able to give yourself credit where credit is due, increasing your sense of self-worth. Instead of focusing on how you perceive your body may look to others, focus instead on how your body feels to you. After all, you are more qualified than anyone else to determine how your body is or is not performing. Boost your self-esteem by looking for healthy activities and hobbies that satisfy both requirements of looking and feeling great. Self-help is one of those things that can only come from within. If you want to stop a bad habit or start a good one it does not matter who tells you to do it. If you are only doing it for someone else, you will never realize the accomplishment you are aiming for. Get organized. Organize your things nightly before going to bed so you are ready to take on the next day. This will help you organize your thoughts for the next day while you are getting things together. This will help reduce stress because you will have your day laid out in front of you. Keep yourself around positive people. Being around people that are positive can be contagious and will change you a way of thinking. It is a bad idea for someone that is depressed to be around those who think negative. It can worsen their depression and cause more negative thinking, which is exactly what you don’t want to do. Follow your heart when choosing your life’s work. That may sound trite, but it really is true that the more passionate you are about what you do, the happier you will be. Don’t make decisions based only on your desire for money. When you love what you do, the money will have no choice but to follow. You must be able to concentrate and focus if you plan on being successful in this life. No one can make it in this world by just talking and offering opinions all the time. You must be able to listen, and you must be able to take the time to learn about new things in a concentrated manner. Each person has strengths and weaknesses; therefore, put into practice the techniques which speak to you. Do your best to follow foolproof methods and you will succeed.

Between soccer and scouts, your school-age kid’s schedule is loaded with fun activities. If you’re on the fence about adding music classes to the list, take note of the benefits that come with signing your little one up for violin or piano lessons. Maybe she won’t be the next Beethoven, but she may have an easier time learning math, practicing good manners (including patience!), and becoming a team player. Read on to learn more about the benefits of music education. It improves academic skills. Music and math are highly intertwined. By understanding beat, rhythm, and scales, children are learning how to divide, create fractions, and recognize patterns. It seems that music wires a child’s brain to help him better understand other areas of math, says Lynn Kleiner, founder of Music Rhapsody in Redondo Beach, CA. As kids get older, they’ll start reciting songs, calling on their short-term memory and eventually their long-term memory. Using a mnemonic device to do this is a method that can later be applied to other memory skills, says Mary Larew, Suzuki violin teacher at the Neighborhood Music School in New Haven, Connecticut. Musical instrument classes also introduce young children to basic physics. For instance, plucking the strings on a guitar or violin teaches children about harmonic and sympathetic vibrations. Even non-string instruments, such as drums and the vibraphone, give big kids the opportunity to explore these scientific principles. It develops physical skills. Certain instruments, such as percussion, help children develop coordination and motor skills; they require movement of the hands, arms, and feet. This type of instrument is great for high-energy kids, says Kristen Regester, Early Childhood Program Manager at Sherwood Community Music School at Columbia College Chicago. String and keyboard instruments, like the violin and piano, demand different actions from your right and left hands simultaneously. “It’s like patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time,” Regester says. Instruments not only help develop ambidexterity, but they can also encourage children to become comfortable in naturally uncomfortable positions. Enhancing coordination and perfecting timing can prepare children for other hobbies, like dance and sports. It cultivates social skills. Group classes require peer interaction and communication, which encourage teamwork, as children must collaborate to create a crescendo or an accelerando. If a child is playing his instrument too loudly or speeding up too quickly, he’ll need to adjust. It’s important for children to know and understand their individual part in a larger ensemble, Regester says. Music Rhapsody offers general music education classes, in which teachers split students into groups and assign each child a task. Whether a team is responsible for choosing instruments or creating a melody, students work toward a common goal. “These are the kinds of experiences we have in society,” Kleiner says. “We need more group interaction and problem-solving.” It refines discipline and patience. Learning an instrument teaches children about delayed gratification. The violin, for example, has a steep learning curve. Before you can make a single sound, you must first learn how to hold the violin, how to hold the bow, and where to place your feet, Larew says. Playing an instrument teaches kids to persevere through hours, months, and sometimes years of practice before they reach specific goals, such as performing with a band or memorizing a solo piece. “Private lessons and practicing at home require a very focused kind of attention for even 10 minutes at a time,” Larew says. Group lessons, in which students learn to play the same instruments in an ensemble, also improve patients, as children must wait their turn to play individually. And in waiting for their turns and listening to their classmate’s play, kids learn to show their peers respect, to sit still and be quiet for designated periods of time, and to be attentive. It boosts self-esteem. Lessons offer a forum where children can learn to accept and give constructive criticism. Turning negative feedback into positive change helps build self-confidence, Regester says. Group lessons, in particular, may help children understand that nobody, including themselves or their peers, is perfect, and that everyone has room for improvement. “Presenting yourself in public is an important skill whether you become a professional musician or not,” Larew says. This skill is easily transferable to public speaking, she adds. And, of course, once a child is advanced enough, she’ll possess musical skills that will help her stand out. It introduces children to other cultures. By learning about and playing a variety of instruments, kids can discover how music plays a critical role in other cultures. For instance, bongos and timbales may introduce children to African and Cuban styles of music. Although the modern-day violin has roots in Italy, learning to play it exposes children to classical music popularized by German and Austrian musicians. Versatile instruments, such as the violin and piano, can accompany a wide repertoire of styles, including classical and jazz (which originated in the American South). It’s important to familiarize children with other cultures at a young age because this fosters open-mindedness about worlds and traditions beyond the ones they know. What to Consider When Selecting an Instrument Ultimately, the instrument you and your child choose should depend on a number of factors. Here’s a list of questions to consider before bringing home a new music maker: Is your child excited about the instrument? Does she like the way it sounds and feels? Some music schools offer a “petting zoo” that introduces kids to multiple instruments. Is the instrument too challenging or is it not challenging enough (for both you and your child)? Does your child’s temperament match the instrument? Can you afford the instrument and the maintenance that comes with it? As a parent, do you like the sound enough to listen to your child practice it for hours at home? Is your child specifically interested in a particular music style? If so, a factor that into your instrument choice, as some specifically caters to certain styles. For instance, a violin player will have a hard time fitting in a jazz ensemble. Experts don’t always agree on which instruments are best for big kids to learn, but many music teachers do agree that it’s hard to go wrong with the piano, percussion (like the drum or xylophone), recorder, guitar, or violin. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

While the other kids were doing seemingly academic activities like tracing letters and singing counting songs, my son stuck with colored pencils. Fast-forward one year later; my son has branched out — way out! He completes puzzles, counts abacus beads, and writes his name in straight letters. Suddenly we’ve shifted from picture books at bedtime to Charlotte’s Web. “When ” I thought, “did he learn all this?” Well, he probably learned it while drawing. Drawing helps kids boost their confidence, improve fine motor skills, get reading-ready, and hone their critical-thinking ability, says Kenneth Wesson, Ph.D., an educational consultant in neuroscience in San Jose, California, who has studied the role of the brain in making art. Although the arts have traditionally been considered fun frills, they’re actually a central piece of the education puzzle. And it’s not just the visual arts. Music can help with math and reading; dance sets a foundation for physical health and also furthers self-awareness; acting can boost vocabulary. Art can impact kids’ emotional and social lives too. “It lets kids take risks without failure and builds confidence,” says Joseph M. Piro, Ph.D., professor in the department of curriculum and instruction of Long Island University in Brookville, New York. While tightened household budgets might make violin lessons a stretch, art instruction need not be formal or pricey. You can expose your kids to dance, music, and drama at home, with stuff you already have. We’ve talked to researchers, art experts, and teaching artists to come up with activities for kids of all ages. Dance The fact that dance builds strength, agility, and flexibility is a given, says Maria Suszynski, executive director of Wellspring/Cory Terry & Dancers, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, but it also boosts confidence and problem-solving skills, and teaches kids about teamwork. Toddlers: Jumpin’ Jellybeans Crank up the music, and let your kid have ants in his pants! Explore every aspect of movement — hopping, leaping high and low, wiggling fast and slow. Following simple sequences gives toddlers’ short-term memory a workout and develops body awareness. Preschoolers: The Shoebox Game Your child pretends she’s in a shoe store where every kind of shoe — antigravity boots, ice skates, shoes that have gum on the soles, or winged sandals — makes her dance in a different way. This stretches a child’s imagination and encourages her to see the world from different angles, says Theresa Purcell Cone, Ph.D., assistant professor of health and exercise science at Rowan University, in Glassboro, New Jersey. School-Age Kids: Human Sculptures Your child dances around you while you make a shape with your body and freeze. Have her build onto your “sculpture” with her own body, perhaps forming a letter or an animal using creativity to solve “problems,” says Dr. Cone. (“How can my arms be a new animal? Oh, I can raise them like butterfly wings!”) Visual Art Kids have been finger-painting and scribbling for eons, but only recently did researchers realize all its ripple effects. Dr. Wesson has found that visual art engages many areas of a child’s brain, including the parts that control decision making, action planning, physical movement, and memory. Attention to detail is a critical component in reading skills too. Toddlers: Pudding Painting Separate a batch of vanilla pudding into a few small bowls and add a drop of different food coloring to each. Dress (or undress!) your child for a mess, and let him “paint” on a surface covered with a plastic sheet. At this age, art should involve many senses, says Susanna Carrillo, founder of Paper Scissors Oranges, an art studio for children in Darien, Connecticut. It’s also a lesson on color mixing — red + blue=purple! Preschoolers: Macaroni Mosaics Mix raw pasta with food coloring or liquid watercolor in a bowl. Spread on a tray to dry, then let kids glue it onto cardboard to make picture frames. Besides emphasizing fine motor skills and the fact that you can make art out of anything, these types of projects provide a fun way for getting kids to stay focused and on task to complete a project — skills they’ll need later in math, reading, and complex problem-solving. School-Age Kids: Life-Size Self-Portraits Have your child lie down on a large piece of craft paper so you can trace the outline of her whole figure. Then have her sketch in the details of her hair, face, clothes, skeleton, internal organs, whatever else she chooses. As she draws, she may need to examine herself in a mirror, which develops her ability to observe and discriminate details — a key skill in reading comprehension. Hang the image on her bedroom door. Drama Pretending to be someone else seems like pure play, but it actually builds serious brainpower. “Acting fosters children’s language proficiency, vocabulary development, and storytelling skills,” says Wendy Mages, Ed.D., an independent researcher in human development and psychology. Toddlers: Take a Trip Flip through a photo album and help your child relive an experience. Encourage him to perform the actions along with the story and use sensory-rich details, like how the apple in a photo smelled and tasted. Having a mental picture of what words mean is a critical skill for new readers. Preschoolers: ID the Object Collect a bunch of items from around the house and put them in a bag. Take turns choosing an item, and try to answer the question “What else can you imagine it is?” by using the object in new and creative ways. (Perhaps the colander becomes a hat or a face mask.) Besides providing a cute photo op, this will help your child learn to think on her feet. School-Age Kids: Bring Books to Life Read your child’s favorite book while he performs the actions. Explain how to dramatize tricky words. (“Gnash” is a toughie in Where the Wild Things Are .) Or pick two characters and put on the “play” together, trying to recall what happens next without the book. Invite an audience (stuffed animals count). Music Things like beat counting, key signatures, and note values draw upon math. But researchers are finding that music may help with reading too. In one study, children who had musical instructions twice a week for three years scored higher in reading skills than kids who didn’t get music lessons. Toddlers: Echo, Echo Even kids too little to memorize lyrics can echo you during a call-and-response song. Using a standard like “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,” insert your child’s name and favorite things, and have her repeat after you. This builds strong memory and listening skills, says Katherine Damkohler, executive director of Education Through Music, a nonprofit in New York City. Preschoolers: Build a Band Help kids invent instruments from stuff you have around the house. Put raw rice into plastic containers to make maracas. Fill some glass bottles with varying levels of water and strike gently to make a xylophone. It’s a lesson in recycling and physics (different levels of water make new notes!). And trying to craft something to create music involves critical-thinking skills. School-Age Kids: Time to Tune In Play a song by one musician and another by a different one — say, Dolly Parton and Duke Ellington.Then have him describe things that were the same about both as well as things that were unique to each. Supply the vocabulary for what he’s noticing — fast vs. slow tempo, high vs. low pitch, names of instruments. Being able to pick apart a sound can boost language and listening skills. 0 Shares Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

Our Performing Arts provision, together with the Film & Media and Art & Design faculties, gives students the chance to step into creative spaces where they develop confidence, collaboration, creativity, and communication – skills that will serve them long after the curtain falls. Building Confidence and Self-Expression From their first Nativity in Early Years to major Secondary productions like The Wiz, We Will Rock You, and Little Shop of Horrors, Sunmarke students are given the stage – quite literally – to find their voice. Standing under the lights, delivering lines, or leading a band builds the kind of confidence that transfers seamlessly to presentations, interviews, and leadership roles later in life. Take Emily in Year 9, for example. She began as a shy pupil who joined Drama Club through our Extra Curricular Activities(ECA) programme. Two years later, she was playing a lead role in Mary Poppins, not only mastering stagecraft but also learning how to collaborate, take risks, and speak with conviction – skills her teachers now see reflected in the classroom. Enhancing Communication Skills Performing Arts at Sunmarke goes beyond acting. Pupils explore storytelling, debate, voice projection, and movement, while Film & Media students take on scriptwriting, journalism, podcasting, and video editing. They learn to communicate across multiple platforms – from delivering Shakespearean monologues to producing original short films. These opportunities mean our students leave school not only as articulate thinkers but as versatile communicators who can adapt their message for any audience. Fostering Creativity and Innovation In today’s fast-changing world, creativity is essential. Whether composing original music, choreographing a dance sequence, editing a film trailer, or designing stage sets, students are encouraged to take risks, test ideas, and approach challenges with imagination. Our electives and Extra Curricular Activities(ECA) strengthen this further – from Choir and Orchestra to Film Club and Technical Theatre. These experiences allow students to discover passions, develop talents, and even consider future careers in the arts and creative industries. Developing Teamwork and Leadership Every performance is a team effort. Students step into a range of roles – actors, directors, stage managers, lighting designers, or sound engineers – learning to rely on one another while also taking initiative. This mirrors professional working environments, teaching pupils to collaborate effectively, respect different perspectives, and lead with empathy. Linking Creativity to the Wider Curriculum The Performing Arts are not an isolated subject at Sunmarke – they connect across disciplines. English Literature supports script analysis, History informs costume design and context, while ICT and Media fuel digital storytelling. This interdisciplinary approach helps students see the relevance of their creative projects within a broader academic framework. Preparing Students for the Future Creativity, adaptability, and emotional intelligence are highly valued in today’s world. Careers in law, business, healthcare, and technology all demand the ability to communicate clearly, present persuasively, and work collaboratively. By nurturing these skills through Performing Arts, Film & Media, and Art & Design, Sunmarke ensures its students graduate as high achievers who are also confident, resilient, and future-ready. More Than Performance: A Pathway to Lifelong Skills At Sunmarke, Performing Arts isn’t just about the applause. It’s about the lessons learned on stage, in the rehearsal room, and behind the camera – lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and self-expression. As our students step into the spotlight, they are also stepping into themselves – learning not just how to perform, but how to thrive. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"

It’s about the lessons learned on stage, in the rehearsal room, and behind the camera – lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and self-expression. As our students step into the spotlight, they are also stepping into themselves – learning not just how to perform, but how to thrive. 0 Shares Prev Next Recent Blogs 28/11/2025 Career Readiness: Why It Matters for Students Today 21/11/2025 Expressive Art and Creativity in EYFS: Encouraging Self-Expression 14/11/2025 How Schools Can Lead the Way in Sustainable Practices 07/11/2025 The Rise of AI in Media: Opportunities for Young Creators 28/10/2025 Fortes Pro Sports Academy at Sunmarke: Nurturing the Next Generation of Student Athletes"
